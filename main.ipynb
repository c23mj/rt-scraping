Music Box Films hide caption Not RatedWith: Ursula Werner, Horst Westphal, Steffi Kuhnert If the woman caught in a love triangle in Cloud 9 passed you on the street, it\\'s unlikely you\\'d give her a second look — let alone imagine the passions bestowed on the 67-year-old seamstress (and the two men she loves) by German director Andreas Dresen. On an impulse, Inge (Ursula Werner) hand-delivers the pants she\\'s just repaired for a customer, Karl (Horst Westphal). After a hasty come-hither glance or two, she climbs straight into bed with him. As in the real world, their robust lovemaking involves full-frontal nudity, and it\\'s shown in unforgiving close-up, which delivers precisely the bracing shock Dresen doubtless intends us to experience. Given the dearth of narrative features about people over 50, I was primed to love Cloud 9 without reserve, if only for its firm rejection of the usual oldster-movie tropes — nostalgia for an idyllic past, well-oiled with flashbacks, or a fondness for doing the splits on a Greek island to recapture the lost vigor of youth. Dresen is only 46, but his characters are unrepentantly old. Their bodies are saggy and wrinkled, their eyes still lively but rheumy. If you saw Dresen\\'s appealing 2005 movie Summer in Berlin, you\\'ll know that glamour is not his thing. Far from sugarcoating the inevitable physical decay of the human body, he gives the process its due, without indulging himself in either tact or bravado. Life-Altering: Inge (Werner) is a home-based seamstress who disrupts her 30-year marriage when she falls in love with one of her customers. Music Box Films hide caption Cloud 9 does have its flaws. Dresen is so relentlessly invasive with his camera that it\\'s hard to decide whether the movie\\'s multiple sex scenes add up to art or to a violation of privacy. Just when he\\'s made you look, you want to avert your eyes. There are clumsy touches, besides, that give away the director\\'s stage background — and his weakness for overkill. The songs Inge sings in her East Berlin choir, alongside other retired women, are the movie\\'s only music; they function rather awkwardly as a Greek chorus, their lyrics commenting where no comment is necessary. Cloud 9 is most moving when it steps quietly into the gap between physical decline and the persistence, at full blast, of unfulfilled longing and desire. The dialogue, improvised by Dresen with three other writers, is pared to a minimum as Inge shuttles, with growing unease, between the ecstatic carnality of her physical communion with Karl and the wordless tenderness and well-worn routines she shares with Werner (Horst Rehberg), her quiet husband of 30 years. Most films about life-changing events build drama by filling the day-to-day lives of their protagonists in advance. Dresen has his reasons for proceeding in reverse, for Cloud 9 is as much about the high cost of romance as it is about the purity of desire. If the first half of the drama makes the case that growing old doesn\\'t necessarily diminish the eternal desire for completion, the second half shows us that the old have much farther to fall in the pursuit of love. A recurring long shot through a doorway into Inge and Werner\\'s meager, lived-in kitchen charts the destruction of their marriage as it segues from companionability, through Werner\\'s rising anger at his wife\\'s restlessness, to her confession and the appalling loneliness that sets in for at least one of this devoted couple. Is Inge justified in claiming an enduring right to fall in love? Or is she — liver spots and all — a spoiled child who, as the fallout from her actions become clear, can only moan, \"I never wanted this?\" It\\'s a great, lingering question, and one that I wish Dresen hadn\\'t felt compelled to cheapen with a programmatically lurid climax.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 3945}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112207012', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2020-09-23', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 662, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'Cloud 9 is most moving when it steps quietly into the gap between physical decline and the persistence, at full blast, of unfulfilled longing and desire.'}}\n",

Amazon Studios hide caption Pressed upon by a demanding mother and a school principal with an amply stuffed shirt, Selah (Lovie Simone), a black graduating senior, plays queen bee over five warring student factions at a pricey but ethnically diverse boarding school that\\'s quite literally covered in ivy. Each faction has its own subculture, its own exchange currency and its own turf to defend. Selah\\'s group, the Spades, dispenses cash, booze and pills to those who offer fealty, and an occasional roughing up to those who don\\'t. She is at once the heroine, the monster and the vulnerable teen at the heart of Tayarisha Poe\\'s impressive first feature, Selah and the Spades, a YA gangster movie that doubles as a soulful meditation on the beauty and danger of power, when all means justify the end of retaining that power. Openly at war with a white rival (Ana Mulvoy Ten), a blond piece of work in her own right who desperately wants to inherit her mantle, Selah befriends and subtly seduces Paloma (Celeste O\\'Connor), a newly arrived scholarship girl in whom she sees shades of her own former self. Both actresses are as lovely to look upon as they are adept with Poe\\'s overly revealing script. A gifted photographer, Paloma acts as our window onto this complicated scenario, in which she plays a part without realizing that she\\'s being sucked into her new friend\\'s skewering of all who stand in her way, including her once pliable sidekick, Maxie. (As Maxie, Jharrel Jerome is every bit as magnetic as he was in Barry Jenkins\\' Moonlight.) From minute to minute, Selah presents as either a power-hungry devil — or she\\'s, well, seventeen and struggling with a serious attitude problem. By turns imperious and insecure, she professes indifference to the usual teen obsessions. Despite the discreetly powerful current that ebbs and flows between her and Paloma, she claims to be uninterested in sex or romance. \"Why not just do things that keep you from crying in bathrooms?\" she asks. Scheming and asserting control are much more fun — until they\\'re not, for either girl. Like many who mobilize others to their dirty work for them, Selah is deeply insecure: Around her ambitious mother (Gina Torres) she\\'s as submissive and fearful as she is poised and decisive at school. Driven by rage and fear, she can\\'t see that a clique can easily slide into a cult. Ably supported by her cinematographer, Jomo Fray, Poe has an assured grasp of lighting and frame composition, and a vivid way with a neon palette that floods the witchy rituals with which young people spice up the dreary routines of school. Poe\\'s serpentine plotting can be tiring in its endless swings between the battles that escalate when an informer is suspected within Selah\\'s obedient ranks. A secret history of betrayal comes to light that threatens to derail Selah\\'s iron reign and warp her friendship with Paloma, who has a stronger core. As the movie moves toward a potentially tragic climax, the gang wars prove less interesting than the struggles of these two girls with adult authority, with themselves and with one another Poe\\'s sensibility is openly feminist, yet Selah and the Spades is built on a central ambivalence that advocates for girl power but warns against its abuse. Though race doesn\\'t come up much directly, it is deeply and implicitly embedded both in the wars between the factions and in the director\\'s vibrant visual aesthetic. For all its genre dressing, in the end Selah and the Spades (along with other strikingly original recent debuts like Pariah, Little Woods and Moonlight) represents the voice of a fresh new generation of black filmmakers that has moved on from tales of inner city poverty or sidelined them for a more introspective spirit. With that, they claim their right make films about whatever floats their boats.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 3880}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2020/04/16/835022015/assured-debut-selah-and-the-spades-explores-the-thin-line-between-clique-and-cul?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2020-04-16', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 654, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'A YA gangster movie that doubles as a soulful meditation on the beauty and danger of power, when all means justify the end of retaining that power.'}}\n",

IFC Films hide caption Note: Resistance will be released on video-on-demand and streaming services on Friday, March 26. Was it some sort of grim prank to cast chatterbox Jesse Eisenberg as Marcel Marceau, the French mime who built a persona out of silence? Not really: For starters, Eisenberg's mother was a professional clown, so the actor knows his way around keeping quiet in whiteface. And you don't have to love mime to get on board for the new movie Resistance, which carries us through Marceau's early years as a fledgling artist turned partisan and child rescuer in World War II France. For the most part the film, written and directed by Venezuelan director Jonathan Jakubowicz, keeps faith with the standard war-hero playbook: Adversity matures a self-involved brat into a courageous rebel who protects the weak from oppression. Which may be close to the truth in the director's read of Marceau's coming of age. Like Steven Spielberg's Oskar Schindler, young Marcel Mangel is not an especially likable fellow when we meet him on the eve of Germany's occupation of France. Cocksure and laughing off the disapproval of his father (Karl Markovics), a butcher, Marcel moonlights as a theater performer, painter, and aspiring playwright. He also mimes in local theaters with a significant prop, a handy little toothbrush mustache that can transform him into Charlie Chaplin — and a shouty Austrian up-and-comer named Adolf Hitler. The actor is also a gifted forger, which will come in handy for changing his name from the identifiably Jewish Mangel to the French Marceau when need arises to fool collaborationist Vichy officials. For a while Marcel pursues his ambition while ignoring the rumble of war, until an act of brutality by Nazis galvanizes him into action as a member of the Jewish Boy Scouts who in life played an active role in spiriting refugee children out of occupied France. And here Eisenberg stops talking and starts to shine. Deploying a simple but profound gesture that would later make him famous — a hand passed over his face from happy to sad and back — the young mime soothes a truckload of traumatized Jewish children whose parents had been killed, often in front of them, by the Nazis. Then he makes them laugh with a walk-against-the-wind routine that would later also become his signature. The scene is less glib than it sounds: My mother, who helped run a hostel in England for displaced Czech and German Jewish orphans during the war, told me that the children would laugh and play during the day, while at night their screams rang out through the dorms. Soon comes a terrible choice between smuggling out the kids Marcel has come to love, or joining the partisan resistance movement that's forming in the forests. His decision is informed by a dreadful encounter that Emma, a cooked-up love interest fetchingly played by Clemence Poesy, experiences at the hands of Obersturmfuhrer Klaus Barbie, the Butcher of Lyon. Played with icy refinement by Matthias Schweighofer, the preening SS officer stands in for and surpasses all the many natural sadists who found an enabling home in the Third Reich. Exploiting his insight that torture works as much by suggestion as by the act itself, Barbie subjects Emma to something worse than death in an effort to extract information about the resistance. That properly numbing scene (the horrors Barbie practiced are well documented) shifts the focus away from Marcel's character and ushers in a series of visceral escape sequences. Jakubowicz handles action with more assured sophistication than he does dialogue, which comes heavily larded with socio-historical speechifying and sugared by a score that's often soggy with cliché. Resistance ends with a pack of kids streaming joyfully across a border and a glowing commendation for Marcel from General George Patton (Ed Harris), commander of the U.S. occupying force in post-War Germany. That's about as close to uplift as it may be possible to get without doing violence to the terrors of that time. Like all films that venture into this territory, Resistance raises the question: What can cinema take from — and give back to — our understanding of the Holocaust, an event so immeasurable and all but imaginable that every story about it comes to seem like fiction, and every ending comes across as spurious closure? Marceau truly was a hero who carried his sadness into his work, and Resistance is an honorable, absorbing homage to the making of a man and his art. But it's not in the same league as, say, Jean-Pierre Melville's brilliant 1969 resistance drama, Army of Shadows or Roman Polanski's 2002 The Pianist, both of which held close to the minute-by-minute state of emergency that the Nazis forced upon those who sought to resist or escape.

Focus Features hide caption Late in Eliza Hittman\\'s Never Rarely Sometimes Always, 17-year-old Autumn (Sidney Flanigan), who is pregnant and in all kinds of trouble, calls her mother from a public bathroom far from her Pennsylvania coal-town home. Her mother asks where she is in a quavering child\\'s voice. After a pause Autumn hangs up, inspects herself in the bathroom mirror, and squares her shoulders. If you saw Hittman\\'s It Felt Like Love (2013) or her Beach Rats (2017), you\\'ll know that the writer-director has little use for exposition. Her scripts are as spare as her soundtracks, so we can\\'t be sure whether this is a coming-of-age moment for Autumn. To the extent that Never Rarely Sometimes Always (the title is drawn from a standard questionnaire administered by abortion providers) is a social issue movie, it\\'s \"about\" reproductive rights in the same way that the formally similar recent film The Assistant is \"about\" sexual assault. Meaning that Hittman attends with near-reverent care to the subjective experience of a traumatized soul who\\'s struggling to take charge of her own destiny. An exacting but artfully suggestive realist, the director offers many mirror shots of Autumn to let us into the interior life of a proud, obstinate young woman confronting a neglectful or hostile adult world. Flanigan, a Buffalo musician in her first acting role, serves up a held-in Autumn whose dull eyes and sullen glower barely conceal the tumult seething inside her. Certain that she wants to terminate her pregnancy but lacking support and money, she turns to a testing clinic that turns out to be an anti-abortion center where, through ineptitude or ulterior motive, she is fed inaccurate information about how far along she is. Tagging along behind her devoted cousin Skylar (Talia Ryder), Autumn heads for New York City, where the camera holds tight on the two girls as they stumble through numerous obstacles in search of safety and self-definition. Where Skylar is practical and fun-loving, Autumn is introverted, intense, socially unskilled. Hittman is powerfully attuned to the unquestioning solidarity and indomitable moxie of teenaged girls, the wordless ways in which they fight and make up — quite literally in fact, when, after a quarrel, Skylar applies concealer under her cousin\\'s eyes. Without a word of apology or defensive self-justification, the two are good to go even though they have nowhere to spend the night. Yet Never Rarely also made me wonder how neo-realism can tip over into partisan over-determinism, distortion, or plain miserabilism? Riveting when it stays within Autumn\\'s point of view, the film wields a heavy hand with the bigger picture of family, authority and most of all, men-in-general. The pro-lifers are soft-spoken liars, the abortion clinic staff uniformly kind and sensitive. Autumn\\'s mother, played with hauntingly ineffectual anxiety by singer-songwriter Sharon Van Etten, is a cipher, pathetically dependent on her boor of a husband (Ryan Eggold), who is not Autumn\\'s father in any sense and is one of several suspects in her pregnancy. Hittman\\'s films are littered with hopelessly checked-out parents, crudely drawn figures of authority who are either all friend or all enemy, savagely predatory men. While Autumn might be forgiven for viewing the outside world through this jaundiced prism, I\\'m not sure Hittman can. Her legitimate subject is the hair-raising vulnerability — and robust fortitude — of young women today. But she tends to put the entire male species on trial and have them come up wanting. As a parent and teacher as well as a critic, it worries me when a young woman filmmaker paints a landscape peopled (unless you count the beleaguered gay teen in Beach Rats) by woman-hating men. The closest to a decent male in Autumn\\'s orbit is the harmlessly horny young doofus (a very good Théodore Pellerin) who has his eye on pretty Skylar. Watching Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Always, I was reminded of a young stranger who, when my own daughter had had too much to drink at a bar, put her and her best friend in his car and dropped them safely off at our home.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4223}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2020/03/12/814639945/a-young-woman-faces-a-choice-in-the-sobering-never-rarely-sometimes-always?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2020-03-12', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 692, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'Hittman is powerfully attuned to the unquestioning solidarity and indomitable moxie of teenaged girls, the wordless ways in which they fight and make up...'}}\n",

Greenwich Entertainment hide caption As we hurtle closer to a time when little kids will look up from their tablets to inquire, \"What was a book, Mommy?\" much as they now ask, \"What\\'s a record player?,\" it may cheer you to learn, from a charming new documentary about bookselling, that while the middle-aged tend to play on Kindles these days, millennials are to be seen in droves reading print books on the New York subway. They\\'re probably also the ones ordering \"vintage\" turntables, and they may be driving the encouraging current renaissance of independent bookstores serving cappuccino on the side, to lure us back from Amazon. The books being bought, sold and read there, though, are unlikely to be the kind found at the New York Book Fair in a gorgeous old building on the city\\'s Upper East Side: ancient tomes, some with curled and peeling pages, others gorgeously illuminated. The handlers of those books are the subject of D.W. Young\\'s beguiling film, The Booksellers, about the world of New York antiquarian book dealers. They\\'re a vanishing breed who, with some exceptions, regard their work more as consuming passion than as career. Though Young dots the testimonial terrain with a few famous book lovers — Fran Lebowitz, Susan Orlean, Gay Talese — most of the story is told by eccentrics you\\'ve never heard of but will enjoy meeting. Dandies in tweeds and bow ties, pear-shaped nerds with sloping shoulders, all manner of Dickensian oddballs, are all as well-represented here as you might expect from this arcane enterprise. Meet the self-described poet, Arabist and sci-fi collector who, with his lanky frame and long twitch of hair, looks to have marched off the pages of an Edward Gorey tale. Or the ruddy-cheeked British auctioneer in country brogues who looks as though he should be posing with a hunting rifle. Or the dealer in a three-piece checkered suit of vintage cut, his face all but hidden behind a handlebar mustache. Sprinkled among this bunch is a small army of older gents who have been in the business since time began. Rumpled, balding and lamenting \"the shattering of concentration\" by smartphones and such, they lurk in decrepit emporia behind teetering piles of dust-encrusted tomes topped by cats with Maggie Smith stares. As Lebowitz observes with glee (of the grumpy owners, not the grumpy felines), \"They don\\'t want to sell you anything because they just want to stand there and read all day.\" And why not, in these treasure palaces in whose cobwebbed corners you can browse away the day and \"find what you aren\\'t looking for.\"? Here\\'s a specialist in radical cultural movements with a focus on the conflict in Afghanistan. That rich dude who made his fortune from Priceline.com shows off a vast, well-tended library with books organized by height, designed as a \"homage to Escher,\" and waiting to be digitized. Rich or poor, almost all cherish their books as physical objects too. One indiscriminate collector, admitting that \"I don\\'t know why I collect,\" proudly picks out a tome entitled Amish Love to underscore his devotion to anything between covers. And guess what? There are women dealers and collectors today too, some of them young, like the elegantly black-clad Rebecca, who\\'s a regular guest on the hit Pawn Star television show, or the exuberant black archivist who collects all things hip-hop. The Booksellers is by no means just an elegy for a dying trade run ragged by astronomical New York City rents, by the internet in general and dread Amazon in particular. It\\'s big business at the top, where the internet drives astronomical prices and millionaires tune into auctions by phone or online (a Da Vinci manuscript famously sold for $28 million not so long ago), even as it impoverishes and displaces those at the bottom. Rich or poor, most of the book lovers in this delightful homage belong to a tribe that grooves to the arcane because they see what others don\\'t in any given book. Most, as the collector with a doctorate in lyric poetry admits with a rueful grin, see themselves in any case as \"not fit for anything else.\" As the three beaming middle-aged sisters who prop up the Argosy book store, sole survivor of New York\\'s famous Book Row, which once housed 50 antiquarian bookshops, declare, \"We like being here.\"', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4353}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2020/03/05/812039518/the-booksellers-speaks-volumes-about-old-books-and-those-who-love-them?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2020-03-06', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 732, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': '[A] delightful homage...'}}\n",

Amelia Troubridge/Sony Pictures Classics hide caption As monstrous cinematic moguls go, Sir Richard McCreadie, CEO of many a failed British cut-rate clothing chain, is no Citizen Kane. Played with casual brio by Steve Coogan in Michael Winterbottom\\'s genre-confounding Greed, Sir Richard is not what you\\'d call a brooder. To him, self-doubt — indeed introspection of any sort — is a loser\\'s game. This despite the judgment of a Parliamentary Select Committee investigating the myriad bankruptcies that have somehow filled his coffers, that he exemplifies \"the unacceptable face of capitalism.\" And never mind the \"Greedy McCreadie\" sobriquet bestowed on him by former colleagues and workers who testify, with full mockumentary gravitas, to his lack of character. Sir Richard doesn\\'t give a damn, and writer-director Michael Winterbottom offers no Rosebud to unlock the psychic key to this soulless sociopath, who\\'s loosely inspired by Philip Green, the real-life owner of High Street retail chains like Top Shop. McCreadie\\'s a bulldozer who berates, bullies and belittles those who get in his way or don\\'t perform up to snuff. He\\'s also, in the way of many charismatic scoundrels who get by on guff and bluff, a waggish charmer whose profanity-laced tirades don\\'t extend to his adored ex-wife and business partner (a malignantly funny Isla Fisher) or his bodacious current squeeze (Shanina Shaik). Winterbottom, who wrote the movie\\'s scabrous script, isn\\'t trying to render McCreadie more palatable exactly, though like a lot of powerful men, he can be as much fun to be around as the similarly brash (if way more soulful) punk rock producer Coogan played in Winterbottom\\'s terrific 2002 romp 24 Hour Party People. Cunningly mounted to satirize the heavy-breathing structure of Orson Welles\\' Citizen Kane, Greed is a jaunty caper littered with farcical flashbacks to McCreadie\\'s formative youth with his ferociously ambitious mother. (She\\'s ably played by Shirley Henderson, a hilarious Scottish aggressor with arms tightly folded around herself as if hoarding trade secrets). There we learn that young Richard is good at nothing except prepping himself to \"make money so I can do whatever I want.\" What he wants, it turns out, is to make millions as a serial killer of clothing stores he buys on the cheap, a 21st-century ploy that makes him prosper even as he sends the firms down the tubes. As usual with Winterbottom, a timely agitprop warning gets folded into the comedy, and here the director holds out McCreadie as a prototype of his time at the turn of the millennium, when failing ever upward became a lucrative business strategy for entrepreneurs with no talent but an abundance of amoral street smarts and an overweening desire to crush all opposition by bidding down to nothing. Back in the present, we meet McCreadie clad in pink flowered shorts and improbable teeth, arriving with his retinue on the Greek island of Mykonos to oversee what should be the final touches to a blowout 60th birthday party for himself. The program features a gladiator arena cobbled together with such cheap labor and materials, it refuses to stand up by itself. Pay close attention to Clarence, a real-life lion who enters the scene with distressingly low testosterone but who will later earn his own 15 minutes, and then some. Loosely sewn together with fishing tackle rather than fine thread, Greed mirrors in tone and style what passes for personality in McCreadie, a prancing hologram of post-capitalist capitalism where success is measured not in product quality but in being seen as a winner. So thickly does Winterbottom coat his villain in moral fog that for a while it doesn\\'t register that, like a virus, the McCreadie Method infects everyone around the preening tycoon, including his official biographer, Nick (rendered deadpan by standup comedian David Mitchell), a rumpled journalist who\\'s increasingly disturbed by the con man he\\'s charged with, as it were, lionizing. Winterbottom means to gradually alert us, too, to the fact that our laughter has made us complicit too. I see his point, but satire rarely shares space comfortably with social-issue drama. Late in the movie the tone and pacing suddenly sober up, presumably to let us absorb the scale of the global damage done by the likes of McCreadie, and not only in the fashion business. Fancying himself an Emperor, McCreadie garbs himself and his acolytes in togas while handing out mandatory slave apparel to his minions and a family of Syrian refugees camped out on the beach. Only they, and an administrative assistant (Dinita Gohil) whose mother perished in India while sweatshopping for a McCreadie company, see the bigger picture of enslavement and displacement around the world. Given the general air of sardonic jocularity, we wait for a punch line. When several hurtle down the pike, it\\'s hard to know whether to cry or snicker behind our hands. Perhaps that\\'s Winterbottom\\'s point, and a fitting dilemma for an age when the unrestrained greed of jumped-up shysters runs amok into absurdity. Somewhere, though, the collateral tragedies set in motion by the Greedy McCreadies of this world get lost amid the bitter laughter.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 5306}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2020/02/27/809318642/greed-a-scabrous-satire-of-a-megalomaniacal-mogul?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2020-02-27', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 856, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"Cunningly mounted to satirize the heavy-breathing structure of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, Greed is a jaunty caper littered with farcical flashbacks...\"}}\n",

Bleecker Street hide caption My first time around with Ordinary Love, I saw two great actors doing their damnedest to breathe life into a pedestrian cancer weepie. I watched it again and saw two great actors bringing grace and depth to an imperfect but affecting chamber piece that takes it for granted that we can handle a de-sanitized drama about a long-married couple doing their best to cope with life-threatening illness. The film is not especially graphic, but unlike most others of its kind, this one trusts us to stick with the slew of treatments that often hurt more than the disease. In its cheekily Irish way it offers a portrait of a great and enduring love under acute pressure. Ordinary Love, which is directed by Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn ( who also made Good Vibrations, a 2013 movie set in Ireland's punk music scene), tracks a traumatic year in the life of retired couple Joan (Lesley Manville) and Tom (Liam Neeson) after Joan is diagnosed with breast cancer. The quiet flow of their days before she got sick — daily power-walks on a peaceful Irish shoreline, amiable squabbling at the supermarket over what doesn't need to go in the shopping cart — is rudely displaced by a staccato new normal of hospital stays colored in chilly blues, punctuated by returns to the murky browns of a cozy home now silent and stained with misery. There the camera directs us to a photograph that signals another unspeakable loss that the couple sustained long before Joan was diagnosed. Here and there a few secondary characters appear, notably Tom and Joan's daughter former teacher (a very good David Wilmot), a gentle gay man who, unlike Joan, knows exactly where his disease is going and struggles valiantly to protect his vulnerable young husband (Amit Shah). Mostly, though, the film is an actors' two-hander, and it's great to see Neeson do muted justice to a role that doesn't require him to whack everyone in sight. Grizzled and bewildered, Tom strains to play the measured optimist to his wife's quietly growing fear of the worst. Neeson comfortably plays second fiddle to Manville, a wonderfully elastic actress who was superb as Daniel Day-Lewis's icy, Mrs.-Danvers-like manager in Paul Thomas Anderson's 2018 Phantom Thread. She was sly as a fox as a preternaturally long-suffering mother of nominally grown nutballs in the recent television series Mum. Sturdy, ironic and practical, Manville's Joan in Ordinary Love is the inverse of her lonely, self-pitying alcoholic in Mike Leigh's Another Year, a crude and cruelly written role that she performed with devotion, but did her prodigious gifts no credit. Here she moves up and down the emotional scale without a moment's excess, registering Joan's mounting panic through her eyes and an occasional flutter of her fingers. Written by Northern Irish playwright Owen McCafferty, whose wife went through breast cancer treatment, the script is wry and witty, if occasionally slipping into TV-movie-speak with glib musings about how we're alone together or how important it is to spend time with loved ones because we're all going to die, we just don't know when. McCafferty steps a bit hard on the mostly amiable fraternal banter that operates as the loving shorthand of many a long and happy marriage. Their squabbling might be all we have to go on verbally; Manville and Neeson flesh out these two sharply contrasting halves into a finely orchestrated, improbably compatible whole built on expressive silences. As she trudges through the increasingly invasive treatments, Joan expresses her fears of the worst while Tom strives to be upbeat. In the face of terrifying uncertainty, the two play out a see-saw of feelings that holds them precariously in balance. Until, that is, the cathartic moment when the dam breaks and they fling recriminations that might break a union built on less solid foundations. Bravely and perhaps quixotically timed to release on Valentine's Day, this modest little drama boasts no saints, only the profound heroism of hanging in.\", 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4178}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2020/02/13/805589580/ordinary-love-scenes-from-a-marriage-touched-by-cancer?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2020-02-13', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 691, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'Unlike most others of its kind, this one trusts us to stick with the slew of treatments that often hurt more than the disease.

Bleecker Street hide caption For a while, in Kitty Green\\'s quietly shattering drama The Assistant, we follow a young factotum named Jane through her dreary daily routines in a prominent New York film production company. The film appears to be shaping up as a procedural of the drudgery that faces college graduates today. Except that there\\'s dread growing slowly here, and an uneasy sense that Jane may be about to experience something worse than the soul-crushing duties that teach her little or nothing about the business she hopes to enter. Expect no monsters to pop out of the drab and dowdy walls of her workplace. This is not that kind of horror movie. Arriving at the office before dawn, Jane, who\\'s played by Julia Garner (Ozark, The Americans), makes coffee, opens packages and sneaks a look at the screenplays she\\'s printing. Once the young male producers she serves trickle in she\\'s kept busy booking and rebooking flights to Los Angeles, fetching lunch, watching over a child dumped on her by a woman who may or may not work there in an official capacity. Green, who also made the 2017 documentary Casting JonBenet, keeps the lighting murky and the camera tight on Garner, who compresses her strikingly expressive features into a telling deadness as Jane performs her duties with rote competence. The recent graduate with a 4.0 grade point average has just enough hope and verve left in her to make the occasional stab at conversation with her superiors, who mostly ignore her but pounce when she slips up on the sandwich order, or snicker behind their hands as she unwillingly fields furious calls from a woman who may be the wife of the company\\'s CEO. Of him there\\'s not much sign other than the occasional barked order or grunt from behind his door. We don\\'t learn his name. Picking up in the boss\\'s office, Jane takes note of stray bits of jewelry and hair ties strewn among the sofa cushions. She finds herself unpacking drugs and syringes along with the bottled water. When she asks why she\\'s writing checks with no names on them, she\\'s told to shut up and get on with it. At last, when she has to shepherd to a fancy hotel a pretty \"new assistant\" (Kristine Froseth) flown in from Boise, Idaho on the company dime, Jane wakes up to the fact that there are more insidious power plays at work here than the ones that confine her to a job that\\'s getting her nowhere. Amid coy hints or thundering silence from everyone around her, Jane tries to drum up support from her colleagues. Her timorous efforts to break the silence that shrouds her meet with indifference, ridicule, and, in one devastating set piece written with crisp minimalism by Green and tautly performed by British actor Matthew Macfadyen, Jane is treated to a punishing assault of gas-lighting and brutal bullying that threatens to disable her. \"What can we do?\" she asks piteously of the executive she turns to for help. \"Do about what?\" he snaps as he lays out a scenario of damage to the company and to her if she spills the beans, and dismisses her with a cruel kicker that blows the lid off every word he\\'s spat out so far. Without resort to a single scene of graphic sexual violence, Green nails down the awful truth that Jane\\'s exploitation is part and parcel of a silent but systemic abuse of powerless and vulnerable women. Even her loving parents are too blinded by their pride in her getting her foot in the hallowed door to listen to her troubles. The young men who believe —or, worse, don\\'t believe — that they\\'re helping Jane by dictating her apology letter to the boss, function as his colluders or, more ominously, his trainees in the sub rosa economy of illicit power. Green won\\'t let women off the hook either. Higher up the totem pole, female employees dismiss Jane\\'s simmering anxiety with cynicism or indifference. \"Don\\'t worry,\" offers one woman in the elevator. \"She\\'ll get more out of it than he will.\" Originally conceived as a documentary, The Assistant draws on many interviews that Green conducted with women from the entertainment industry. She devotes almost anthropological attention to the sordid folkways of a tribe with an arcane and secret life of its own. Word is out now, and no woman needs to feel as alone and abandoned as Jane does. Given the ongoing flood of testimonies to the media and in court, it\\'s still way too early to call this terrific little drama a period piece.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4505}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2020/01/30/801182889/the-assistant-when-a-workplace-s-silence-can-t-be-broken?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2020-01-30', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 785, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"Without resort to a single scene of graphic sexual violence, Green nails down the awful truth that Jane's exploitation is part and parcel of a silent but systemic abuse of powerless and vulnerable women.\"}}\n",

Gkids hide caption The premise of Makoto Shinkai\\'s captivating new anime, Weathering With You, plays out just a whisker away from the storyline of his 2017 smash hit Your Name, about a teenage boy and girl who switch bodies, time and place. In both films a country boy moves to the big city and meets a mystery girl with special powers. Here the two, both refugees from less than adequate families, get caught up in a galloping plot of rescue, redemption and growing up, wrapped in a love story drawn from ancient Japanese legend. In Your Name a comet threatened to take out a Japanese island; in Weathering With You (a title to make grammar pedants wince, though its target audience won\\'t give a damn) Tokyo drips and sweats through a summer of unceasing torrential rain that frays the nerves of its residents and threatens to drag underwater a city that already lies below sea level, vulnerable to sudden storm surges. Climate change, drawn from hair-raising reality, plays a defining role here too. Shinkai may be dipping his toes in his own pre-tested global market. But Weathering With You rises gracefully above its copycat blueprint, and not least because it offers a fresh vision of grungy urban beauty, shrouding the otherwise garishly lit city of Tokyo in a watery grey-blue palette featuring rising fog below and gorgeously menacing cumulonimbus formations above. With their saucer eyes and tip-tilted noses, our young heroes may look like standard issue out of Studio Ghibli, where Weathering\\'s animation director Atsushi Tamura once worked. But unlike the older generation of Ghibli directors like Hayao Miyazaki, who set his bold boys and girls down in enchantingly sunlit animated country towns with meadows of waving buttercups, Shinkai speaks to a more knowing middle-school manga demographic whose onscreen happy places are the seamier crevices of big cities. An innocent newbie with a Salinger novel tucked into his backpack, Hodaka (voiced by Kotaro Daigo) is a nerdy cipher of a boy who doesn\\'t want to go home because \"it\\'s boring.\" It goes without saying that the movie\\'s end goal is to grow him up under the tutelage of Hina, a far more knowing girl navigator of Tokyo\\'s grimier interiors. She\\'s the beguiling trainee witch from Miyazaki\\'s Kiki\\'s Delivery Service, if you like, all grown up into a savvy burger-joint server shrouded in old-world mystery. Hina (voiced by Nana Mori) is energetic and practical, but she\\'s also a work of the director\\'s imagination culled from Japanese myth — a \"sunshine girl\" chosen by who-knows-from-up-there to carry a special skill. With mind rising above body, she can conjure a blue hole in the clouds and stop the rain with nothing more than a prayer, if only for a short while. Together Hodaka and Hina make a resourceful power team, constantly adapting to the shape-shifting challenges of the inner city jungle as they go into business together selling Hina\\'s gifts to those who need to clear the skies for special events. For added sweetness, Hina comes packaged with a little brother, Nagi, who\\'s quite the ladies\\' man given that he hasn\\'t hit his second decade yet. His success with girls in braids will come in useful when, in its penultimate chapter, Weathering With You turns into a hectic action movie, complete with a recklessly waving gun and a Vespa chase with another brazen hussy at the handlebars. A tributary plot involving Hodaka\\'s boss drives home the populist message that even the villains of the underworld have their sunnier sides as unexpected rescuers. For all their courage and newfound moxie, Hodaka and Hina\\'s youth make them vulnerable to the authorities because they\\'re doing things that are prohibited to minors. The thin thread that binds Hina, and all of Tokyo, to the volatile heavens threatens to break, and Hodaka must figure out how to man up enough to release his love from her age-old obligations as a human sacrifice. Weathering With You doesn\\'t quite measure up to the haunting lyricism and youthful longing of Your Name. But the tragedy that looms over Hina and Hodaka, and Tokyo, and the planet, echoes the anxieties that plague a generation terrified and angry at the warming and wetting their elders have done their best to ignore.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4400}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2020/01/16/796244614/wholl-stop-the-rain-she-will-weathering-with-you?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2020-01-16', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 735, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'Shinkai may be dipping his toes in his own pre-tested global market.

Amazon hide caption A melodrama to its high-strung core, Karim Aïnouz's Invisible Life is rich in outsized emotions, most of them pouring out of two devoted young Brazilian sisters forcibly separated through the multiple follies of their authoritarian father. If love — sisterly, carnal, maternal, you name it — blazes on the front burner of this intermittently gratifying tale (based on a 2005 novel by Martha Batalha) of domestic woe, destructive patriarchy marches right along behind, ready to stomp on the slightest push for female autonomy or self-definition. The curtain rises on a cramped Rio de Janeiro household in the early 1950s, where fantasies of escape seethe within sensual 20-year-old Guida (Julia Stockler) and her younger, taller, more cerebral sibling Euridice (Carol Duarte). Two blowsy, fine-boned beauties with clouds of black hair and intense dark eyes, each in her way is avid for freedom from traditions that bind them to dependence on the whims of their father or the bourgeois spouses he chooses for them. Guida, a good-time girl looking for love and sex, takes off with a feckless Greek sailor, only to return home all but barefoot and heavily pregnant. In her absence Euridice, her lifelong ally and a gifted pianist with plans to attend a music conservatory, has been married off against her will to a stolidly unimaginative postal worker (Gregorio Duvivier) who thinks he owns her. Guida is thrown out on the street by her rigidly appearance-conscious father (António Fonseca), who with his aghast but submissive wife (Flávia Gusmão ) gazing mutely on, also tells his wayward daughter that her sibling has taken off for Europe for good. Their long separation and the one-way epistolary chain that chronicles one sister's longing for reunion with the other, becomes the scaffolding that holds together the separate struggles of each to survive and realize her dreams, with neither one of them aware that the other lives close by. While Euridice fights to keep her ambitions alive amid the demands of parenting and marriage to an insecure man, Guida must cobble together a female community that sustains her as a single parent and a worker in a manual job commonly done by men. Ainouz, who made the 2002 drama Madame Satã, lights his sets with a warm, primary-colored richness that calls to mind the films of Pedro Almodóvar. There are lovely moments of grace — Euridice dangles her long legs in a swimming pool as she contemplates the possible failure of her plans; Guida tenderly ministers to a beloved companion who's dying of cancer. When the two sisters cross paths in town with a hint of the other's presence, the movie takes on the tantalizing echo of a strange fairy tale rich in serendipity. In Almodóvar, though, extremity is pursued less to sustain belief in plot than to heighten common emotions of aspiration, joy, and grief into soaring universality. Lacking the Spanish filmmaker's antic celebration of eros, his sympathy for tragedy in his characters of all genders, his poised control over mood and habitat, Aïnouz takes cover in unrelenting hysteria. Hitching an absorbingly domestic scenario to a broader polemic against Brazilian patriarchy whose currency he sees as primarily sexual, Aïnouz floods the women's every sexual encounter — a rape in one form or another — with a male brutality that borders on sadism. Male boorishness and female over-excitement are ladled on to a visceral degree that strains belief and, worse, makes us want to look away. Traducing genuine suffering as mere histrionics (even the scaling of a fish becomes an excuse for violence), Aïnouz unnerves and alienates where he might illuminate. In its subtler scenes of delight and sadness, its moments of kindness to men imprisoned themselves by tradition, Invisible Life offers loving and perceptive tribute to Aïnouz's mother and her generation of strong but stymied women. Notable among them is an eleventh-hour treat with the galvanizing appearance of the great Brazilian actress Fernanda Montenegro (Central Station). It would ruin everything if I told you whom she plays — or her role in a moment of transfiguring, deep solace.\", 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4276}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2019/12/19/787932682/two-sisters-separated-by-hardship-long-to-reconnect-in-invisible-life?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2019-12-20', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 697, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'Traducing genuine suffering as mere histrionics (even the scaling of a fish becomes an excuse for violence), Aïnouz unnerves and alienates where he might illuminate.'}}\n",

Magnolia Pictures hide caption When we meet Alice (Emily Beecham), a single mother and bio-engineer devoted to her work in the effectively creepy indie Little Joe, she\\'s busy propagating a plant whose smell will make all interested smellers happy. So far so plausible: Tampering with nature in the name of the public good — or because we can — is all the rage in life and in movies. Around Alice, apparently normal workplace stuff is going on. A pompous boss (David Wilmot) asserts his authority just because. An ostentatiously diplomatic young assistant with big hair (Phénix Brossard) lurks. A seemingly timid older worker, Bella (played by the terrific New Zealand actress Kerry Fox, who\\'s most famous for her role as Janet Frame in Jane Campion\\'s An Angel at My Table), brings her beloved dog Bello to work. For now, the only irritant in Alice\\'s workaholic routine is the crush her colleague Chris (Ben Whishaw) nurses on her. She swats him away and comes to work in stiff shirts buttoned to the neck. But Austrian director Jessica Hausner (Lourdes, Amour Fou) is a sly one with signaling. She wants you to notice Alice\\'s coiffure, which looks like an inverted bronze buttercup and doesn\\'t move much when she does. The flowers blooming nicely in the lab, whose clinical pastels deepen at critical plot points into livid reds and purples, look shiny and hyper-real and emit a crimson pollen that makes people sneeze, and more. A jarring whine buzzes on the soundtrack like a chorus of electronic crickets, cunningly blended with a soothing flute from Japanese composer Teiji Ito. Workers move about slowly in their crisp, mint-green lab coats, murmuring to one another in incrementally menacing undertones. Zombie time? Not exactly: Multiple possible realities seethe on and below the surface of Alice\\'s everyday world, and like all the best Alices on page and screen, this one is about to fall down a deep rabbit hole. In fact, though she energetically suppresses a vague unease she speaks of only to her forbearing therapist (Lindsay Duncan), Alice is already on a slow but steady slide downhill. A single parent, Alice is torn between her devotion to her cherubic adolescent son Joe (Kit Connor) and her need for time to perfect the cultivation of a plant that will oblige with perfume so long as its owners nurture it as they would a child. Flouting lab rules, she brings a bright red new plant home for Joe to care for, naming it Little Joe. That makes two little Joes to worry about, and on one level Alice\\'s inner conflict echoes that of a multi-tasking young widow and single mom whose home is invaded by a monster in Jennifer Kent\\'s domestic horror movie The Babadook. As in The Babadook, the question before us is whether a mother\\'s growing doubt and distress are the result of her inner conflict or of the increasingly aggressive behavior of her plants? Does that shirt Joe is wearing have a bull\\'s-eye target in the chest area, or is it just an innocent tie-dye? Are her son\\'s growing distance and passive resistance just the normal struggles for autonomy of an incipient teenager, a subtle bad seed, or a smart kid who knows his mother better than she does? To add to Alice\\'s troubles, her male colleagues start to gang up on her and on Bella, whose history of mental illness they cunningly exploit. Like many heavily designed films that speak from a conceptual great height, Little Joe allows us only a narrow field of emotional engagement moving between discomfort to dread with a side of mordant comedy. But that leaves us free to toggle between a fairy tale of the Grimm variety and a hyper-realist story of science, nature and the contemporary female psyche. Is the Viennese director calling our attention to what Freud called our everyday miseries, with all our attendant strategies of denial and hysteria? Or, as the flowering and fizzing red plant now sitting innocently in her therapist\\'s hallway hints, have the gung-ho scientists been defeated by the imperatives of nature? \"We only ever find what we\\'re looking for,\" a wised-up Bella tries to warn Alice. Whether or not she heeds that advice, in the end our heroine makes a choice, or a \"choice,\" that everyone seems happy with. At the end of Little Joe Hausner slips in an audacious validation of women\\'s ambition that\\'s sure to ruffle feathers both male and female. Whichever malign source of her anguish you chose to take on board at the outset of this clever thriller, Alice doesn\\'t live there any more.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4658}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2019/12/05/784110201/in-the-clever-little-joe-horror-is-horticultural?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2019-12-05', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 792, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'Effectively creepy...'}}\n",

BritBox hide caption For better and worse, class pride has always run a deep vein through British society, upstairs and down. Not so the United States, where the mere mention of social class often triggers strenuous manifestos about meritocracy and equal opportunity. Which may be why attempts to reproduce Michael Apted\\'s long-running Up anthology — inquiring into the persistence of social hierarchy in post-World War II Britain — have so far failed this side of the Atlantic. For those who think Downton Abbey is pretty much a documentary, the Up series is the perfect antidote. Beginning in 1964 with 7 Up, directed for British television by Paul Almond with Apted initially on board as a researcher, the series tracked a cross-section of 14 children from England\\'s famously rigid class system, with Apted checking in every seven years thereafter to document what and how they were doing. I\\'m roughly the same age and grew up lower middle class in London, so I\\'ve followed the series obsessively from soup to nuts. But you don\\'t have to have been as hooked as I on the anthology (now available as a boxed set) to find your way around the latest, 63 Up, which is studded with flashbacks to catch you up on how the group has fared since we first met them, mingling to frolic and brawl in a grim-looking adventure playground. Inevitably a quiet tempo has settled on the hopes and dreams of these sexagenarians as they answer questions from Apted or go about their business with varying degrees of discomfort under cameras that have dogged them for decades. Some have retired; others contemplate their own mortality as they tell of parents passing away. One is seriously ill; another has died since 56 Up. Most seem content with what they have and express few regrets about what might have been. Luck, love, and loss, triumph and defeat, have beveled the edges of even the most pugnacious and intrepid. Through every installment, Apted has peppered (some say, resentfully, pestered) the group with questions about whether England\\'s class divisions have grown more permeable. For some the short answer has become versions of \"for the love of mike, Michael, quit asking, we are so much more than our station in life.\" Apted deserves credit for including their protests. The long answer to his probing is: It\\'s complicated. Take Tony, the charming, infuriating Cockney child of London\\'s East End, and the only Upper who frankly enjoys the limelight. As a teenager Tony predicted some of his future with astonishing accuracy, becoming first a jockey and then (\"If I\\'m not good enough\") a cab-driver. Both jobs came to pass, but what Tony couldn\\'t dream of was that he would one day buy a handsome holiday home in Spain for his growing family and plan to build a resort there. What followed had more to do with the global economy than with his business chops, but today Tony, a proud husband, father, and grandfather who moonlights as a cabbie in TV crime shows, has switched his working-class-Tory affiliation for fear of Brexit, and may cast in his lot with the Green Party. At the other end of the social spectrum we revisit John, at 7 and 14 a snobby, upper-crust brat and easily the least likable of the Up children. Now tweedy and balding, a considerable mellowed John (who also guessed right that he would become a barrister) is happily retiring to devoting himself to charity work in the Balkans with his wife. Our early assumptions about John\\'s wealth and blue blood turn out to be mistaken, though there\\'s no doubt that his pricey education has given him more financial security than most of the Uppers. Certainly John hasn\\'t had to struggle like Symon, the group\\'s only mixed-race member, who grew up in a children\\'s home with his friend Paul. At 7 Symon wanted to be a movie star; at 21 he worked a sausage factory assembly line. Without functioning parents, Symon has had a checkered life. What he and Paul (now settled in Australia) have achieved with the support of two good women is by any measure remarkable, as is the fact that they\\'ve stayed friends. And after some difficult years as a divorced single parent, the congenitally cheerful Sue — one of three East End women who, at 21, gave Apted a brisk mouthful for asking them only family-oriented questions — heads a career counseling unit at London University. And what of Neil, at 7 a bonny lad in a duffel coat skipping down a suburban Liverpool street and by any measure the most beloved of viewers? At 28 we saw him homeless and roaming the British countryside. All I will say is that after a lifetime battling his biology and a less than idyllic childhood, at 63 Neil is not without faith, friends or resources. Every chapter of the Up series has seen its dropouts, and with the exception of Tony, those who remain express reservations with varying degrees of vehemence. For John, whose early arrogance so antagonized viewers, each new episode has brought \"a little pill of poison.\" Over time Apted\\'s questions have grown more personal, but he still queries them about whether they still believe Britain to be a class society. All agree that inequality persists, but they worry less for themselves than for their children, who face cuts to the country\\'s generous welfare state services, further concentration of wealth in the top tier, the decline of full-time jobs, and most of all the potential ravages of a looming Brexit deal. Like Nick, the farm boy who became a professor in the United States, and Apted, who attended Cambridge University but now lives in America, I found far more career opportunities in the United States than I would have enjoyed in England despite a fancy education. Yet I\\'ve been struck by the nervousness that any discussion of social stratification inspires among students I\\'ve taught down the years in American universities. And I miss the stout class solidarity that, however diluted by upward mobility, remains strong among the English working class. British cinema has always had a far more robust tradition than U.S. of narrative films about the relations between the classes. Documentary offers the same satisfactions of family drama, the common hurts and losses endured and surmounted in movies by Mike Leigh or Ken Loach or the classic post-War Angry Young Men films, while permitting no facile class stereotypes. No one in 63 Up sounds like anybody above or below the salt in Downton Abbey. We don\\'t see them gulping endless cups of industrial-strength tea or spending every waking hour down the pub or at the private club. As Apted narrows his focus to the personal more than the overtly political, he has also learned from the Uppers that there is no such thing as an ordinary life; that money and education may carry you far, but that accent and income bracket have little to do with intelligence, wit, or goodness of heart. What\\'s striking is not just the sturdy durability of family and community, but (camera or no camera) the fundamental decency of just about every participant in this long cultural experiment. Rich or poor, all have ended up devoting themselves to helping others. So \\'bye for now, dear Uppers, and with luck and longevity, see you at 70 Up.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 7282}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2019/11/27/782599189/once-more-unto-the-brits-63-up?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2019-11-27', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 1243, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"What's striking is not just the sturdy durability of family and community, but the fundamental decency of just about every participant in this long cultural experiment.\"}}\n",

Lacey Terrell/Sony Pictures hide caption On the face of it, director Marielle Heller\\'s exhilaratingly impolite indie resume doesn\\'t make her an intuitive fit for a movie about the nicest man in the world — let alone a big studio picture starring nice Tom Hanks. Heller\\'s 2015 feature debut, The Diary of a Teenage Girl, was voiced by a sorry-not-sorry young woman who initiates an affair with her mother\\'s boyfriend. In her second, last year\\'s Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Heller cast the beloved Melissa McCarthy as the robustly unlikable real-life literary forger Lee Israel. Next to Mister Rogers — in the eyes of many, a saint and a children\\'s hero — these two seem not to stack up. Heller is not much into saints, but she delights in ill-fitting outliers. And Fred Rogers, in his slow and soft-voiced way, was a willing anachronism to the brash new late-sixties world that greeted the arrival on PBS of his earnestly old-fangled children\\'s television show, Mr. Rogers\\' Neighborhood. Rogers\\' real-life buddy, journalist Tom Junod (Matthew Rhys plays Junod\\'s cinematic stand-in \"Lloyd Vogel\" in Heller\\'s film) lovingly described the kid-show-host as \"a rather peculiar man.\" So he was, and how much more so he seems now, in today\\'s quarrelsome noise. Rogers was a Presbyterian minister and theologian whose on-set uniform was a comfy cardigan, tie, and sneakers. Turned off by the shrieking pie-in-the face cartoons that were standard children\\'s television fare, he slowed the pace way down, listened to children\\'s darkest fears and anxieties without wishing them away, and showed them how to manage those fears. The roots of his empathy in his own troubled childhood were beautifully told in Morgan Neville\\'s lovely 2018 documentary, Won\\'t You Be My Neighbor?, which became the top-grossing biographical documentary ever. A Beautiful Day is not that story; it\\'s not really Fred\\'s story at all. The movie is a kind of procedural that shows how Rogers worked — persnickety and willfully distractible, he drove his adoring crew round the bend — on and off the set the set of his show, in this case to free an unhappy man of an enormous psychological burden he\\'d carried all his life. Inspired by Junod\\'s 1998 Esquire cover, the film turns on the unexpected friendship that grew between the two men out of an assignment that the hard-hitting news reporter was forced into by his hard-nosed editor. (Were he alive today, I\\'m sure Fred would join me in saying: So nice to see you again, Christine Lahti!). Sensitively played by Rhys (The Americans), Lloyd is a glum and grumpy fellow despite his glitzy job and new fatherhood with a supportive wife (Susan Kelechi Watson). Within minutes of their first phone call, Rogers (Tom Hanks) senses that Lloyd is in unresolved emotional trouble. The movie\\'s running joke, and its tenderly serious point, is Fred\\'s gently firm switch of the spotlight back on his resistant interlocutor, reframing the questions Lloyd is wrongly asking. Heller sprinkles the action with realist scenes of Lloyd\\'s current struggles with his absentee father (Chris Cooper), a feckless drunk trying ham-fistedly to make amends. But the film is also a fantasy, and in lesser hands than Heller\\'s, the visual devices that carry us through A Beautiful Day — toy-filled miniature models of The Neighborhood and the cities both men travel through — might register as unbearably coy. In fact the sets feel organic to Rogers\\' central belief that in order to become fully functioning adults, everyone — especially the suffering children that he and Lloyd once were — should remember what it felt like to be a child. Lloyd, who has built an impregnable fort around his pain and rage toward his father, finds himself imaginatively folded into the puppet-littered sets Rogers has built for his younger audience. Some of this is played for laughs, others to warm the heart. But lest you think Heller gilds the lily, Junod\\'s article is there to verify some of the movie\\'s seemingly improbable moments, among them a scene in which Fred is serenaded with one of his own songs by passengers in his subway car. Even if you think Rogers\\' psychological model is simplistic, you can\\'t help but climb aboard. Operating with a shrewd mix of imitation and interpretation, Hanks deepens Fred Rogers from a man-child with a prankish sense of humor into a healer whose struggles with his own demons (as an overweight child he was bullied and called \"Fat Freddie\") have led him to empathize with, as Lloyd puts it, \"broken people like me.\" Hanks\\'s sincere performance argues for a heartening lack of space between Rogers\\' public and private personas, between himself and his puppets. He understood the darkness in children\\'s lives and gave them — and all the damaged Lloyds and Freds of this world — a way to grow into adults who understand that being good is endlessly renewable hard work.

Sony Pictures Classics hide caption An extended family gathers with assorted significant others in a beautiful countryside retreat. Troubles are shared, grudges and loves declared and forsworn, regrets — they have a few. There\\'s no resisting the scenically upholstered family saga, which over the years has spawned a sublime European cinema with contributions from the likes of Jean Renoir, Francois Truffaut, Ingmar Bergman, Bertrand Tavernier and many others. American filmmaker Ira Sachs enters this territory with loving nostalgia and a fine eye for the ravishing backdrop, but little feel for the deeper fissures of domestic life. Front and center in Sachs\\' new film Frankie is French matriarch Frankie (Isabelle Huppert), a snooty actress who has commandeered her family for what, it\\'s broadly hinted, promises to be a momentous vacation in the Portuguese resort of Sintra. The town offers enticing views of sun-drenched hillside steeples and ocean views, and nearby lies a heavily symbolic misty forest through which meander Frankie\\'s fractious multi-generational friends and family. They\\'re played by a starry ensemble that deserves better than wandering in and out of frame, moping in ritzy French and British accents over amorous distress and existential stasis. Certainly the key role is a criminal waste of Huppert, a tidal wave of passionately emotional enigma blazing out of a tiny physical frame who doesn\\'t do types if she can help it. Here she struggles with caricature as Frankie, an aging star with an ill-concealed secret, a wardrobe in tasteful shades of magenta and blue, and a quietly supportive husband (Brendan Gleeson), who does a lot of leaning against walls, smiling at grief. Jettisoned former spouses appear in person or in spirit, but one loses count. Frankie comes to us as the kind of piece of work that has been a staple of countless man-made women\\'s melodramas since the 1940s — sharp-witted, sharp-tongued, shrewd about others but a stranger to herself. She doesn\\'t mince words, but you could practically mouth the words she doesn\\'t mince along with her as she tries to fix up her pouty son (Jérémie Renier) with her hair stylist and best friend Ilene, played by an under-used Marisa Tomei in a strange peasant dress. Cheerily plain-spoken in her all-American way, Ilene arrives with a bland boyfriend (Greg Kinnear), who\\'s hungry for stability. Further offspring (Vinette Robinson and Ariyon Bakare) bring up the admirably diverse rear from England, bickering madly to underline the thorniness of marriage. Sachs builds a physical world so relentlessly clean, classy, and gorgeous it teeters on the edge of travelogue. But he fails to people it with characters we could care much for or about, so busy are they shilling for banal observations on life. Huppert\\'s palpable efforts to hold back and preserve mystery end up fatally undercut by a screenplay (written by Sachs with Mauricio Zacharias) at once portentous and thin. Which leaves the actress trying to inject fullness into topic statements like \"I try never to confuse money and love\" and injunctions to her family to \"pretend that you accept my fate.\" All too soon, it becomes crystal clear that Frankie\\'s fate is hers to accept. Heavy on art-film trappings and paced with Bressonian slowness but skin-deep on fresh interpretation, Frankie leaves us with little to do but nod gravely at the sadness of life and check off, or Chekhov, Sachs\\'s themes of failure and regret, mortality, and acceptance of that which we can\\'t control. At the climax Frankie plays a soft piano with Jimmy looking on, then takes what might be a final walk through the rustling leaves, landing up on top of a mountain. It\\'s not what you think, but it\\'s not much more either. \"To have family,\" the New Yorker critic Richard Brody writes in a fond appreciation of Francois Truffaut, who would have worked magic with this setting and these actors, \"is to prepare oneself for loss and grief.\" That is Sachs\\' subject too, but unlike Truffaut he doesn\\'t explore it.

Manolo Pavón/Sony Pictures Classics hide caption Late in Pedro Almodóvar\\'s wonderful new drama, Pain and Glory, there comes a tough and tender flashback in which a filmmaker hears from his elderly mother (Julieta Serrano) that the neighbors don\\'t like being portrayed in his movies. \"I don\\'t like auto-fiction,\" she adds with a note of acid reproof we rarely hear from the devoted maters, blood and surrogate, who people Almodóvar\\'s movies. Forgive the director, on- and off-screen, his evasive grin. Every Almodóvar film fairly drips with auto-fiction, mostly in disguise and sometimes in drag. In Pain and Glory, which completes Law of Desire (1987), which launched Banderas\\' career, and Bad Education (2004) in a trilogy centering on filmmakers navigating passion and loss, Almodóvar recreates his own history from his childhood in rural Spain in the sixties through his first real love affair amid the sexual freedom of post-Franco Spain. The film is an elegiac fiction from the viewpoint of a director in early old age, but it cuts so close to the bone of Almodóvar\\'s own aging that he used furnishings and clothing from his own Madrid apartment, transformed into a place of primary-colored artistic delights that its owner is too bummed to enjoy. Played by Antonio Banderas in hedgehog hair only slightly less upstanding than Almodóvar\\'s own wild and woolly \\'do, filmmaker Salvador Mallo has fallen into a dreadful funk just as a restored 30-year-old film of his goes into re-release. Salva doesn\\'t care. He\\'s obsessed with the creeping aches and pains of bodily decline, as well as more intense spinal pain that may signal more serious illness and prevents him from working. This being Almodóvar, the ailments also spark some imaginative visual high-jinks with x-rays and such. Mooning about the house to the disapproval of the usual phalanx of sturdy women who prop him up, Salva retreats into memories of his youth and, inevitably, regret at paths not taken and his apparent failure to grow into the son he believes his mother wanted. And really, who could fail to try and please Penelope Cruz, doing an effortless Anna Magnani as Salva\\'s young mother, a peasant so resourceful that she can create a graceful home out of a cave? Luckily, Salva is a radically unreliable narrator of the pickle he\\'s in and in his conviction that he will make no more films. There is, in fact, a script gestating in his head, however addled with medication and a nascent, if incompetent, heroin habit. It\\'s a monologue about the several kinds of addiction that have shaped its writer\\'s life — to substances, to sex and loves both maternal and romantic, to filmmaking itself. He can\\'t see it yet, but Salva\\'s deep dive into the past, along with some re-encounters with key figures he\\'s lost touch with — an early crush, his first great love, an estranged actor from his early film — also build a history, at once fictional and true, of how his experience, not formal education, have shaped his distinctive cinema. Performing at his mature finest, Banderas moves up and down the emotional register from mournful to puckish to regretful to freshly hopeful with a restraint that dials down Almodóvar\\'s breathy melodrama almost to straight realism. The bright reds and blues that decorate his other movies are muted in the apartment where Salvo holes up in self-isolation, brightening only when women come in to rescue or when he ventures out into the sharp light and dramatic dark of Madrid, whose beauty and squalor have fed his imagination for three decades. Always, though, there is Almodóvar\\'s gift for cinematic abandon, for the sheer joy of the vibrant, just-because image: Women singing as they spread sheets on bushes to dry; an older actor (Asier Etxeandia) growing young before our eyes as he undulates his hips in a sexy dance as he revs up to deliver the monologue a demoralized Salva refuses to perform himself. And yes, there are sex and drugs and flashes of coarse humor, but you could take your grandmother to see Pain and Glory, and for that matter almost any Almodóvar movie, brimming over as they do with populist warmth and mother-love. Late in Pain and Glory, Salva gets an offer that he\\'d almost certainly have leapt to accept as a younger man. Now he refuses, gently, with affection — and with good reason, for his recollections and re-entry to the world beyond his apartment have turned Salva, not into a man reborn exactly, but a man returning to himself on the understanding that pain and glory come and go, but his work is far from done.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4677}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2019/10/03/765092044/almodovar-looks-back-with-regret-and-conviction-in-the-elegiac-pain-and-glory?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2019-10-03', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 788, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"Performing at his mature finest, Banderas moves up and down the emotional register from mournful to puckish to regretful to freshly hopeful with a restraint that dials down Almodovar's breathy melodrama almost to straight realism.\"}}\n",

Sony Pictures Classics hide caption Flamboyant, terrifying, and pointedly timely, Matt Tyrnauer\\'s documentary Where\\'s My Roy Cohn? tells the story of one of America\\'s most notorious political fixers while grounding him in an American half-century that allowed him to seed, and thrive on, its worst impulses. For older moviegoers and those who saw him represented in Tony Kushner\\'s magisterial two-part play, Angels in America, the resurrection of Roy Cohn evokes painful memories of anti-Communist hysteria in the McCarthy hearings and the Rosenberg trials; the stigmatizing of gays in the military and the State Department; the rampant corruption of a decadent New York in the 1970s and \\'80s. In all of these, Cohn played toxic enabler or profiteer; and more often than not, both. For younger audiences growing up in our own pugnacious age, Cohn will cut an all-too-familiar figure. A brilliant lawyer with no respect for the law and a flagrant liar as needed, Cohn was an attack dog springing for the throats for all who got in his way and many who didn\\'t. Tyrnauer suggests, none too implicitly, that Cohn\\'s scorched-earth tactics laid the groundwork for the paranoid style of politics that cuts America down the middle today. With his tailored suits and pale eyes, Cohn cultivated a just-try-me stare that eerily prefigures the hard-bore stare of that other kingmaker, Trump aide Stephen Miller. Yet Cohn, a celebrity hound who partied hard at Studio 54 and rarely turned down an interview, lacked Miller\\'s willingness to operate mostly from the shadows. A writer for Vanity Fair who, along with other non-fiction films about unsavory Hollywood types, made a non-fiction film about Studio 54, Tyrnauer passes smoothly over the well-known facts of Cohn\\'s early life as the adored only child in a family of status-conscious string-pullers. Tyrnauer can be glib, and he\\'s not above the occasional cheap shot. In the film\\'s least prepossessing scenes about Cohn\\'s ambitious mother\\'s influence over her son, the director takes an undercover swipe at her alleged \"unattractiveness,\" then gratuitously fortifies it with gleeful tattling about Dora Cohn\\'s \"ugliness\" from Cohn\\'s cousin, the feminist writer Anne Roiphe. Nothing if not comprehensive, Where\\'s My Roy Cohn? fully exploits footage pulled from Tyrnauer\\'s anonymously sourced access to Cohn\\'s personal archive, which gives us his incongruous stuffed frog collection as well as copious photos of his hangouts with handsome young men and his partying with the likes of Andy Warhol, Norman Mailer, former New York mayor Ed Koch, and his childhood friend Barbara Walters. (His \"engagement\" to the latter petered out from sheer inertia.). More ominously, audiotapes of journalist Ken Auletta\\'s 1970s interviews with Cohn reveal a belligerent bully given to flat denial of this notorious homophobe\\'s homosexuality and of proven facts that he cheated clients and the tax man and bent the law every which way to suit his purposes. Gilding the dramatic lily with a floridly overbearing score, Tyrnauer marshals a small army of Cohn adversaries, journalists, family, and former colleagues. Today few have a good word for their mentor, boss or friend. Yet many (his protégé Roger Stone is predictably chatty and catty) betray a grudging admiration for the man\\'s baleful charisma and his ability to attach himself to power. Until, terminally ill with AIDS, Cohn fell from grace at last, disbarred for cheating a client. Then most of Cohn\\'s friends scurried away at speed. Among the departed was Donald Trump, another Cohn protégé who pops up at regular intervals in the movie hobnobbing with his mentor and an assortment of pols and mobsters. From Cohn, witnesses assert, Trump learned his propensity for feint-and-dodge strategy, his rabble-rousing appeals to patriotism bolstered by denigration of designated Others. Mincing no words, Where\\'s my Roy Cohn? takes its title from a frustrated outburst Trump directed at his former Attorney-General Jeff Sessions. Was Cohn just an exceptionally nasty, if hardly the only, piece of work who clawed his way to the top over the corpses of others? Or did he, as the film implies, personify the American psyche in one of its darkest periods? Tyrnauer offers no explanatory voiceover, but Where\\'s My Roy Cohn? offers a visceral reminder that a sense of history matters, perhaps especially in our own brawling, encamped time. A look at the past shows us that this is not the first time, nor the last, that we will inhabit a nation bitterly divided against itself by leaders — and their handlers — whom we cannot trust to tell the truth or safeguard our best interests. Whether we can hang onto our democracy anyway lies beyond the film\\'s horizons — but not all that far. I, for one, left the theater grateful that Cohn never lived to get his hands on social media.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4994}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2019/09/19/760647922/documentary-where-s-my-roy-cohn-suggests-he-s-closer-than-you-think?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2019-09-19', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 807, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'Flamboyant, terrifying, and pointedly timely...'}}\n",

Sure, the film is rife with soapy domestic dysfunction. There\\'s co-dependence to burn between Mel (Mandy Patinkin), a bitter playwright past his prime, and his nominally grown daughters, Rachel (Hannah Pearl Utt) and Jackie (Jen Tullock). Unhelpful baggage will be shed. For dessert, insight and forward movement. Yet this slyly titled movie, a nimble collaboration between director Utt and co-writer Tullock, is wise, witty, and richly specific in its evocation of a family limping along on a wobbly foundation of secrets and lies. Though they\\'re a tight unit, Mel\\'s daughters are yin and yang; the costuming alone speaks volumes. Stage manager Rachel, who\\'s much given to turtlenecks, jumpers, and crew socks, is a lesbian with no love life, indeed not much of any life at all outside her efforts to keep her father and older sister solvent and out of trouble. To her sister Jackie, a flighty actress and spottily attentive single parent who favors dueling floral kaftans over a wide-open bosom, Rachel dresses \"like a Mennonite caterer,\" one of many zingers in a crisply funny screenplay. Each sister, in her own way, is stuck in fealty to the heedless diva of a father they both adore. When Mel dies suddenly, the siblings discover that their sense of the world and their places in it have been built on a fairly spectacular whopper. The mother they\\'d been told was a) derelict and b) dead turns out to be very much alive, if not exactly thriving. A melodramatic aging actress hanging on in a third-rate soap opera, Sherrell is a familiar type enlivened by deft writing and a ferociously committed performance by Transparent\\'s Judith Light. The actress\\'s extravagant physical comedy is cunningly edged with pathos and a steely indomitability that compels her ambivalent daughters — one vying for her attention while the angry other tries to back away — to revisit how they\\'ve been conditioned by their father to see her. Each is also her mother\\'s daughter: Jackie is theatrical, inclined toward all things pink, and casual about parenting her remarkably unflappable tween daughter (a preternaturally poised Oona Yaffe), who seeks help from a more reliable role model, the family\\'s kind, stable accountant (Mike Colter). Rounding out the able cast is a lethally deadpan Alec Baldwin as a far from disinterested family therapist. Warmly lit with a bold palette of lime greens and deep reds, Before You Know It suggests a world at once inviting and claustrophobic — emblematic of the dilemmas that face Rachel and Jackie as they juggle family loyalty with the pull toward independence. Utt and Tullock excel at tempering the antic hysteria of soap parody with a rhythmic slow burn of drama in which the sisters pry themselves loose from a destructive myth and discover that both their parents are capable of both less and more than either sibling could have imagined. Before You Know It dances playfully, and in sober earnest, around the friction between the commitments of motherhood and a woman\\'s fight for a life of her own. Irreverently feminist but generous in the mercy they bestow on all their flawed characters as they flounder through life, Utt and Tullock hold the ambiguity all the way through to a boldly weird scene late in the movie. Mel\\'s ghost materializes before one of his daughters, and when she seizes the moment to plead for a sign of his pride in her, they both collapse in laughter. Does Mel live on, even in death, as a withholding SOB? Is he offering his daughter a life challenge? That, as Rachel tells her sister by way of nudging her to take responsibility, is for all of us to figure out as we forgive our parents their sins and stride forth to commit our own.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4163}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2019/08/29/753807016/before-you-know-it-a-charming-soapy-comedy-about-family-secrets?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2019-08-29', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 703, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'Wise, witty, and richly specific in its evocation of a family limping along on a wobbly foundation of secrets and lies.'}}\n",

Tore Vollan/Danish Film Institute hide caption Unless you\\'re of a certain age or a United Nations history buff, chances are you\\'ve never heard of Dag Hammarskjöld, the U.N.\\'s second secretary-general and a man noted for his commitment to protecting newly independent African nations from their colonial masters. Hammarskjöld\\'s integrity earned him many corporate and Western state enemies, which is one reason why sabotage was suspected when his plane crashed in 1961 as it neared touchdown in the small town of Ndola, Zambia, then called Northern Rhodesia, killing him and most of the crew. You won\\'t learn a whole more about Hammarskjöld the man from Danish filmmaker Mads Brügger\\'s satirically jovial inquiry into the crash, because it\\'s not long before Cold Case Hammarskjöld lifts off into a docu-thriller that carries us deep into some frightening corners of global skulduggery. In the words of the director, who appears early and often as a goofy guide to his cheerfully ham-fisted process, the cause of Hammarskjöld\\'s death was \"either the world\\'s biggest mystery, or the world\\'s most idiotic conspiracy theory.\" If the latter, a deadpan Brügger apologizes up front. A while later, when the trail to Hammarskjöld\\'s possible murderers seems to run cold, the director announces that he didn\\'t much care about him anyway. All of which may give you some idea of this film\\'s unsettling tonal weirdness and narrative unreliability. Up to a point. Cold Case Hammarskjöld is really two conjoined mysteries, both so artfully constructed that there\\'s no way to tell whether their chronology evolves organically or whether Brügger had his biggest surprises in hand from the beginning and withheld them so as to spring a full-blown horror thriller on us. The film begins as a tongue-in-cheek procedural about Brugger\\'s \"efforts,\" with Swedish private investigator Göran Björkdahl (who has a personal interest in the case), to dig up the plane\\'s wreckage. In a scene that plays out like a particularly demented episode of the British television mockumentary The Detectorists, Brügger brings on pith helmets and shovels, a metal plate with holes in it that may or may not be bullet holes. Balding and bespectacled with a trimmed ginger beard, the strenuously performative director dictates his progress on the case to two quizzical African secretaries whose commentary he solicits. Brügger appears dressed in white to mimic the unvarying garb of a \"villain\" who may or may not have had a hand in murdering Hammarskjöld. As Brügger tells it, the two sleuths stumbled on the \"fictionalized memoir\" of a shadowy South African who may have been a key operative in a secretive paramilitary organization with tentacles reaching to Hammarskjöld\\'s plane crash. Either that, or he was barking mad. Or both. All this docu-satire is amusing enough, though as gonzo journalism goes, it\\'s mild stuff and a bit windy. Mercifully, just when you\\'re ready to agree with Brügger\\'s disclaiming admission that he\\'s a lousy journalist and storyteller, the trail runs cold. Only then does the story roar back to sinister life, while the telling turns solemn. The memoir, along with the testimony of a host of other dubious customers, lead the two sleuths to the kind of source every reporter dreams of, a quietly sober man named Alexander Jones with haunted eyes and a stain on his conscience that he seems to want desperately to clear. As he talks, the information Brügger has already amassed reconstitutes itself on a broader, deeper landscape into a tale of racism and white supremacy, conspiracy to overthrow governments and infect whole indigenous populations with the AIDS virus. Is Jones a credible witness? Given his own prosecutable involvement, he has little to gain and a great deal to lose by going on camera. The beans he spills tell an astonishing tale of the space provided by organized covert operations (that reach all the way to Britain\\'s MI6 and the CIA) to crazed eccentrics who find a stage on which to play out their paranoid, self-mythologizing fantasies. Then again, given that we live in times when the truth is what powerful people say it is at any given moment, this sorry tale, which unfolded at the height of the Cold War, astonishes only in the sense that we can\\'t blame it on the Internet. And what of the man who may have died because he posed a threat to Western domination of the African continent? Early on in Cold Case Hammarskjöld, Brügger wonders, in his disclaiming way, whether Dag was a \"boring Swedish technocrat\" or \"a flaming idealist.\" By the end of the film, he has answered that question and given us ample reasons to mourn the passing of a man who, had he lived, might have helped shape an Africa less vulnerable to plunder than the one we see today.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4949}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2019/08/15/750812549/an-unreliable-narrator-a-trail-colder-than-pickled-herring-cold-case-hammarskj-l', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2019-08-15', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 817, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"Just when you're ready to agree with Brügger's disclaiming admission that he's a lousy journalist and storyteller, the trail runs cold.

Joel Bernstein/Sony Pictures Classics hide caption Blink and you might miss a priceless bit of fly-by news footage in a new documentary about rocker David Crosby, he of the sixties bands The Byrds and endlessly self-dissolving combinations of Crosby, Still, Nash and Young. Emerging from a spell in prison for gun possession and drug abuse in the mid-\\'80s, Crosby — shorn of his signature walrus mustache, knitted cap, and cocksure charisma — might easily be mistaken for a low-level clerk in a button-down shirt and nondescript pants belted over an ample paunch. Waving cheerfully to the press, Crosby throws them a quote about being ready to move on with his music and cleaner living. David Crosby: Remember My Name mostly lets Crosby tell how his rehab didn\\'t happen in a straight line. But the sartorial lapse we glimpse in that clip is funny, shocking, and telling, and not just in exposing that where pop stars are concerned, wardrobe makes the man. In that moment, unfortified by his hippie trappings, Crosby reverts to the awkward, ignored child he was forever trying to transcend. As is often the case (see, among many others, Rocketman), a remote, unyielding father hovers over the musician\\'s lifelong struggle with anger and pain. Floyd Crosby was an award-winning cinematographer who shot High Noon, but, his son tells us without noticeable self-pity, he never told his two boys he loved them. Luckily, there was a loving, music-loving mother to pick up some slack. The rest curdled into free-floating rage that almost killed Crosby, hurt friends and family by the score, yet rarely found its way into his bands\\' ecstatically countercultural vibe. In that sense, the film hews close to the familiar rock-doc arc from troubled childhood through early fame and fortune devolving into drugs, booze, and sex, then evolving into better living through the love of a good woman, in this case Crosby\\'s wife of many years, Jan. Except that with Crosby, redemption is always a pending thing. Riddled as he is with the life-threatening illnesses that often catch up with hard living, Crosby knows he\\'s likely to die soon with a lot of loose ends untied and emotional debts unpaid. That\\'s the main thread in a film that keeps other talking heads to a minimum and either lets or makes Crosby talk. Whichever it is — his off-screen interlocutor is the rock journalist and film director Cameron Crowe, who started writing about Crosby when he was sixteen and now counts himself a friend — the musician needs little prodding to unburden himself of fear, guilt and regret over all the misspent years. Passionate, wry, often bellicose, but always a candid and pithy storyteller, the now-whiskered Crosby often seems to be writing his own self-lacerating obituary. He yearns for forgiveness from the countless women he hurt and longs — with more ambivalence — to reconcile with his former band members, none of whom speak to him to this day. The film carries us along on Crosby\\'s recent tour with a band of young musicians (one of whom is director A.J. Eaton\\'s brother Marcus) to showcase his more experimental new compositions, an effort to make up for decades of wasted creative time. While they\\'re at it, the filmmakers also schlep an amusingly reluctant Crosby around his past haunts, among them the cute Laurel Canyon cottage that inspired Graham Nash\\'s song \"Our House.\" Though that song, along with \"Teach Your Children Well\" and others on their famous album Déjà Vu, come across as no more than soft-rock catchy tunes today, in context they functioned as beloved anthems for a generation equally fired up by political resistance and hippie utopianism. The blissed-out \"Our House\" was written by Nash while living with Joni Mitchell, fresh off her own fraught affair with Crosby. His wised-up account of his behavior in that relationship testifies to the dark side of the counterculture that produced the Manson murders along with the free love-ins. The unvarnished tour worth taking in this film is Crosby\\'s brutal account of his junkie years, the crazed conspiracy theories he peddled to whomever would listen and many who wouldn\\'t (a former band mate remembers him as \"insufferable\" and Crosby doesn\\'t quibble), the women he let down, and worse, pulled into his own addictions. Life and a loving wife have beveled Crosby\\'s sharp edges, but to its credit David Crosby: Remember My Name doesn\\'t tie the musician up in a contented end-of-life bow. Toward the end there comes a scene at a 2015 Christmas tree lighting with then-President Obama where Crosby, Nash and Stephen Stills sing \"Silent Night\" totally off key. The lack of synchrony is so ridiculous and so moving that you desperately want these estranged rockers to fall about laughing or melt into a group hug, or something that will bring them back together. When Crowe suggests turning up on Neil Young\\'s doorstep to say sorry, Crosby\\'s helpless answer may make you weep.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 5061}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2019/07/18/741887503/wasted-on-the-way-a-musician-looks-back-in-david-crosby-remember-my-name?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2019-07-18', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 845, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'Passionate, wry, often bellicose, but always a candid and pithy storyteller...

Aviva Layton/Roadside Attractions hide caption Marianne & Leonard: Words of Love, a warmly absorbing new documentary by British filmmaker Nick Broomfield, opens with an image of a beautiful young Norwegian woman steering a sailboat off the sun-soaked Greek island of Hydra. The footage, which was shot by famed documentarian and Broomfield mentor D.A. Pennebaker on a visit to the island in the 1960s, recurs from slightly different angles throughout the film. But Marianne Ihlen — an early lover of Leonard Cohen and the subject of several of his most famous songs including \"So Long Marianne\" — doesn\\'t steer this moving, sympathetic, but ultimately frustrating tribute. Perhaps inevitably, Cohen does, via Broomfield\\'s fascination with the singer\\'s tortured relations with the many women he romanced. Ihlen and Cohen met in 1960 on Hydra, which at that time was forming as a hub of literary hippies with full subscriptions to the sexual revolution. The two had in common uncommon physical beauty and a sense of themselves as refugees, she from an abusive partner, he from the Orthodox Jewish family that both confined and inspired him. They became lovers, and Ihlen sustained Cohen through the writing of his early novel Beautiful Losers. Juggling a deftly edited mix of footage, the voices of Cohen and Ihlen, and well-chosen testimony from friends of both, Broomfield covers the often excruciating bouts of parting and reconnecting that marked their relationship. Theirs was a love match, everyone agrees, but a brief one with a long tail of grief for Marianne, who repeatedly put her own life (and, tragically, that of her son Axel) on hold to be there for Cohen. Once he found his voice and his fortune as a singer, Marianne gradually got left behind, though he supported her financially, and their liaison sputtered on between Greece, Norway, Montreal and New York as Cohen got fully on board for free love. With his trademark blithe disregard for the boundaries between narrative and non-fiction, Broomfield has cheerfully inserted himself into a bunch of impish but keenly observed and compassionate portraits of, respectively, Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss, rocker Courtney Love, serial killer Aileen Wuornos and Sarah Palin. Depending on how you feel about his resolutely non-ideological approach, Marianne & Leonard is either the best thing he\\'s done or uncharacteristically circumspect, almost self-effacing. I say almost because Broomfield casually admits up front that he was, briefly, Marianne\\'s lover on Hydra, and the two remained friends until her death from leukemia in 2016. The film is his least transgressive, but also most mature portrait of a woman who, by her own admission, suffered from crippling insecurities exacerbated by the claims to artistry of those she hung out with. Counterculture enclaves were rife with such women, and though Cohen waxes ecstatic onscreen about the movement\\'s gender parity, Broomfield (a bit of an Apollo in his youth too) gives the hippie moment its due while remaining admirably clear-eyed about the emotional wreckage and broken families that the sexual revolution left in its wake. Marianne & Leonard founders, though, in sticking Ihlen within the vexing label of muse, which in its mostly male iteration functions as code for a passive beauty who makes the meals and clears the terrain, makes no demands and sits — in Marianne\\'s case, quite literally — at the feet of genius. (She\\'d have needed heroic reserves of forbearance to cope with choice cuts of early Cohen-speak like this one: \"When I got up in the morning I had to decide whether I was in a state of grace.\") Genius, in return, is full of worship until the muse wears out her welcome. We see Marianne only through the attenuating fog of her beauty and her equable nature, where she languishes as a placeholder for all the women Cohen loved (or at least obsessed over) and left. Late in life Cohen is heard regretting his own heedlessness. It\\'s not that Broomfield has cooked the books of Marianne\\'s history with Cohen. Indeed to the degree that he ever takes sides he\\'s with her and, probably correctly, identifies her as a somewhat tragic casualty. But though his focus keeps veering away to Cohen, he allows another woman, the vivacious and psychologically astute Aviva Layton (who was married to Cohen\\'s friend and fellow writer Irving Layton and knows the price of taking up with a congenital escape artist) to provide crucial insight into Marianne\\'s plight, as well as the reasons why she was so widely beloved of men and women alike. Layton is perceptive, too, about Cohen\\'s symbiotic bond with his intense mother, from whom he inherited a lifelong struggle with depression, and about her influence on his inability to sustain relationships with women. As she lay dying in a hospital, Ihlen asked a friend to contact Cohen. Close to death himself, he wrote her a widely publicized letter of farewell, only this time minus the grandiloquence. \"So Long, Marianne\" is a beautiful melody, but willy-nilly, Broomfield\\'s sensitive tribute to its subject — and object — makes crystal-clear why it was never her favorite of his songs.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 5306}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2019/07/05/737111020/in-documentary-marianne-leonard-words-of-love-free-love-comes-at-a-cost', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2019-07-05', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 866, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"Marianne Ihlen doesn't steer this moving, sympathetic, but ultimately frustrating tribute.

NEON hide caption The rising Irish actress Jessie Buckley, who plays an aspiring Scottish country singer in the beguiling new film Wild Rose, is small and scrappy with hot brown eyes and a mane of chestnut hair tossed into a rough ponytail. Buckley has bags of pugnacious charisma and a soaring, throaty singing voice tempered with enough vulnerability to make us want to hold her close even as the screw-up she offers us drives everyone in her orbit up the wall. Buckley plays Rose-Lynn, a chaotically disorganized single mother of two who's determined to elbow her way up from the Glasgow projects to sing her way to country stardom in Nashville. Getting in the way, in no particular order, are her resentful mother (Julie Walters), who's been taking care of the kids; the ankle bracelet Rose-Lynn must wear as she emerges from a year in prison for getting caught with a bag of heroin she insists she never used herself; and no money for the flight or anything else. All of which augurs a galloping case of British movie miserabilism. Except that director Tom Harper, with a cheekily energized script from Nicole Taylor, is working a whole other kind of groove than anything on offer from Ken Loach or Mike Leigh. There's sadness to burn in Rose-Lynn's young life, but her spirit is as brassily exuberant, sardonically funny and musically switched-on as that of Glasgow itself, a brawling, culturally vibrant metropolis whose grungy beauty is eloquently captured by cinematographer George Steel. Nashville comes across pretty scenic too. As it is said across the pond, what's on Rose-Lynn's lung is on her tongue. Failing ever upward, she mouths off to everyone who crosses her, gets herself fired from her old job and lands another as cleaner to a rich patroness (a warm and winning Sophie Okonedo). When opportunity knocks, she dumps her kids on Mum as needed. Harper isn't all that invested in plot, and he plays delightfully loose with the film's basic realism: Rose-Lynn vacuums her way through her boss's opulent mansion with a full complement of imagined backup musicians. Further fairy god-persons magically turn up to propel Rose-Lynn forward through all manner of improbably fortuitous turns as she makes her way to London and glam parts beyond. All of which might build to the triumphant end of the road in another, more American story of ascent to fame and fortune. In Wild Rose the winning is something more muted and durable, more typical of British ambivalence about success if it means deserting your class or your family. In American versions like the recent Teen Spirit with Elle Fanning, the upward mobility does the heavy narrative lifting. With Rose-Lynn it's the resetting of priorities that may yet set her free to define her future. Buckley is enormously expressive, running up and down the scale between despair, rebellion, elation as she belts out original numbers co-written with Taylor, complemented by a full-hearted soundtrack of well-known country tunes. In a nicely turned scene toward the end of Wild Rose, Rose-Lynn stands alone in a Nashville studio she's crashed, and breaks into a soulful ballad. A group of session musicians — live ones this time — forms around her. She's arrived, you think. Not quite. There is collateral emotional wreckage to be cleared away, and who more bracing than Mum to oversee the cleanup? If you're old enough to remember Julie Walters as a similarly unfiltered young hairdresser hungry for schooling in the delightful 1983 indie Educating Rita, you'll know that as a younger woman she'd have made a terrific Rose-Lynn. Now 69, this ineluctably British actress can still deliver a killer funny line and cut up as needed (Calendar Girls, Molly Weasley in the Harry Potter franchise, Brooklyn are a notable few). In her prime Walters has also distinguished herself in serious supporting roles as an array of maternal types, most recently in Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool as the wise mother to Jamie Bell who cares for Annette Bening's dying Gloria Grahame. Rose-Lynn's mother, Marion, is a more complicated woman who's had to fend for herself, give up much and cover endlessly for her clueless child. For much of Wild Rose, with her mouth set in a rigid line of disapproval, Marion seems to be holding Rose-Lynn back. In fact she's nudging her daughter forward — just not in a straight line.\", 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4485}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2019/06/20/733367782/a-wild-rose-grows-in-glasgow-with-dreams-of-getting-transplanted?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2019-06-20', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 754, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'Buckley has bags of pugnacious charisma and a soaring, throaty singing voice tempered with enough vulnerability to make us want to hold her close even as the screw-up she offers us drives everyone in her orbit up the wall.'}}\n",

Peter Prato/Sundance Institute hide caption Elegies for a dead or dying San Francisco lie thick on the ground, but a ravishing new film made by two friends who grew up there offers a loving elegy for the city's black community. The Last Black Man in San Francisco is about a man trying to reclaim a house. It's also about reclaiming the history of the Fillmore district, a neighborhood dubbed the Harlem of the West whose black families were pushed out to the city's outer margins long before Google buses rolled in to drive up prices and exile artists and oddballs (see Tales of the City) of all stripes. In the quietly domestic tradition of African-American filmmakers Charles Burnett (Killer of Sheep, To Sleep With Anger) and Barry Jenkins (Moonlight, If Beale Street Could Talk), the film will repay your patience with a wistful fairy tale built from real-life materials. An unhurried tone poem with no guns and next to no blood, Last Man is a tale of race and the city, not Race and the City. First-time director Joe Talbot is white; his collaborator, Jimmie Fails, is black; they grew up together in Fillmore. This is Jimmie's story, and he plays himself. Early on we find Jimmie lovingly touching up the trim on a beautiful but run-down Victorian house in Fillmore. The house is occupied by a white couple who seem more exasperated than appalled by the takeover. Jimmie politely insists it's his own because his grandfather built it before being driven out of Fillmore. He'll be back and they'll be gone, but that is not the takeaway. You'll have to wait till the end of the film to find out whether or not Jimmie's account is true. At this moment his tale is vividly, life-savingly true for Jimmie, who shows and tells it in poetically staged fragments to his doubtful but endlessly supportive best friend Mont (Jonathan Majors, of White Boy Rick and When We Rise), a kind soul who shelters Jimmie in the home he shares with his blind grandfather (Danny Glover). Mont is his own kind of artist, a playwright who also sketches the lives of the dispossessed who haunt the city's down-at-heel outskirts. A supporting Greek chorus of non-pro locals doing what they do — singing, preaching, yelling their lament for the death of their community — adds to the movie's hand-made, often goofball charms. A marginal among marginals, Jimmie is a Don Quixote searching for meaning and purpose through his struggles with the house's occupants; with a realtor who may be friend or foe; with a gaggle of gangbangers who hang out on the corner, harassing him with catcalls; with the naysaying father who now languishes in SRO housing; and in one achingly poignant encounter, with the mother he lost at a tender age. Busying himself with a quest that at best may becalm his life, at worst may hurt him, Jimmie marinates in nostalgia that may hold him back, but that works to enhance the movie's unabashed visual romance. Talbot and cinematographer Adam Newport-Berra wash the city inside and out with a golden light reminiscent of Jenkins' exquisitely luminous Moonlight, and with breathtaking shots of the two friends skateboarding down one of San Francisco's plunging hills and along its streets, pursued by the shouts of a bearded man shedding his clothes. The Last Black Man is a sequence of undeniably lovely grace notes that don't always cohere. Yet the movie is held together by the progress of Jimmie's conflict with himself, with a narrative he's used to spin a protective cocoon around his wounds. In that sense it's a parable about the power of the stories we tell ourselves to carry us through the chaos of living — and also to hold us back from getting on with our lives.\", 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 3790}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2019/06/06/729778759/the-last-black-man-in-san-francisco-is-a-ravishing-achingly-heartfelt-elegy?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2019-06-06', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 655, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"The Last Black Man is a sequence of undeniably lovely grace notes that don't always cohere.

Joe D\\'Souza/Amazon Studios hide caption In Ritesh Batra\\'s new film, Photograph, a villager scrabbling to make a living on the streets of Mumbai falls for a well-heeled young stranger whom he\\'s persuaded to pose as his fiancée in order to please his grandmother. That hook is a durable staple of Hollywood and Bollywood movies alike, and both industries leave a strong footprint on Batra\\'s mildly arthouse love stories. If you\\'ve seen the director\\'s genial, if skin-deep 2014 hit The Lunchbox, you\\'ll know him as a storyteller who\\'s preoccupied with romance across social and geographical divides. The Lunchbox, in which a stray food delivery sets up an epistolary romance between a lonely housewife and a testy widowed accountant, was a big hit in Batra\\'s native India and in the Unites States, where he now lives. And there\\'s more than a whiff of winning formula straining to repeat itself in Photograph, whichthrows two strangers together across India\\'s rigid class divide and watches what happens as they haltingly try to reset the rules of non-engagement imposed by family and tradition. Clocking in at just under two hours, Photograph takes its sweet time ripening a connection that may or may not mature into enduring love. The action — if that\\'s what you call two people wandering around Mumbai — unfolds with the slow, intimate rhythms of classic Indian cinema, lightly juiced with the goofy high spirits and populist common touch of Bollywood. At first glance the movie\\'s heroine, Miloni (Sanya Malhotra), looks like any modern young Indian woman confidently navigating the streets of Mumbai, a teeming jungle where old and new rub boisterously against each other. Though her bourgeois family wants to wrap her in a pink sari and marry her off to the first suitable bidder, Miloni comes casually dressed in t-shirt and jeans, her curly hair cut short. She\\'s also a celebrity on the city\\'s billboards, where her head, topped with a ridiculous crown, looms over the crowds on ads for the business accounting school where she\\'s a star student. In fact, Miloni\\'s a quiet introvert whose soulful dark eyes betray yearnings unsatisfied by her comfortable middle-class existence. When a lowly street photographer named Rafi (played by Bollywood star Nawazuddin Siddiqui) tentatively offers Miloni a photo he\\'s just taken of her at the Gateway to India, a tourist spot where all sorts mingle, she\\'s at once wary and intrigued. She\\'s Hindu and well off; he\\'s Muslim and dirt-poor. The two come from opposite sides of India\\'s strict class divide, but they have in common shy, reflective natures, and by accident and design they keep bumping into each other as they crisscross the city. Each has something the other wants. Miloni, we learn, feels more of a kinship with the maidservant (Geetanjali Kulkarni) who sleeps on her floor than she does with her own well-meaning parents. Rafi — who\\'s desperately trying to pay off family debts so that he can prevent the sale of the village home of his grandmother Dadi (Farrukh Jaffar) — also needs, or thinks he does, a woman to stand in as his betrothed when Dadi visits. An attentive and loving world-builder, Batra carries us between their disparate milieux, with most of the movie\\'s amiable humor emanating from within the ramshackle space in a cavernous structure that Rafi shares with other migrant workers from his village, and where his grandmother bunks down without complaint. Love blooms in the cracks between Rafi and Miloni\\'s worlds. So, too, does nostalgia: In one lovely scene shot in a woozy haze of light, the reticent photographer, who still addresses his beloved as \"Madam,\" goes in search of a favorite Cola drink that\\'s no longer sold, and finds a lone old man brewing one bottle at a time. Bonding cheerfully with the putative bride, Dadi will turn out to be a lot wiser and less hidebound than her loving grandson gives her credit for. Tradition must be shed, yet what follows is more an accommodation than a rebellion. Photograph suspends itself, as only a movie can, between cheerful endorsement of mix-and-match modernity and inchoate longing for a gussied-up past that at least one of the lovebirds never actually experienced. That is cake both had and eaten, and in India\\'s current stridently divisive world, and ours, the sweetly conciliatory and hopeful fantasy is welcome.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4466}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2019/05/16/723977097/photograph-captures-romance-blossoming-across-mumbai-s-class-divide?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2019-05-16', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 737, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"The action - if that's what you call two people wandering around Mumbai - unfolds with the slow, intimate rhythms of classic Indian cinema, lightly juiced with the goofy high spirits and populist common touch of Bollywood.\"}}\n",

Seniors go cheerleading in Poms. STX Entertainment hide caption \"I\\'m here to die,\" cancer patient Martha (Diane Keaton) announces to a boosterish reception committee as she arrives at the Georgia retirement community where she plans to end her days. Martha is a lifelong single who has accrued little in the way of family or friends. Now, having refused all treatment and polished off her own estate sale, she expects no fireworks (hold that thought, though) from her imminent demise at Sun Springs, a pricey pastel village dotted with semiotically resonant golf carts, water aerobics, and funeral buffets. That\\'s about as much grim reality as you can expect before POMS, a comedy of senior manners from British director Zara Hayes, shunts you smartly into uplift and good cheer. With barely plausible speed, reclusive Martha succumbs to an unlikely friendship with her free-spirited neighbor, Sheryl (Jacki Weaver, channeling Betty White). Unlike her surly grump of a new pal, Sheryl likes a good time (she attends funerals for the free food) and she quickly unearths the fun fact that Martha was, in her day, a whiz-bang cheerleader who never got the chance to perform. Working their way around stiffening joints — and through the forces of reaction,, a.k.a. Vicki (Celia Weston, radiating great gusts of disapproval) — the brand-new bosom buddies follow their bliss by founding a cheerleading club of eight diligently diverse women and steering them into competition with a nubile cheerleading squad from the local high school. POMS was inspired by photos that Hayes had come across of cheerleading retirees around the world. So it\\'s a real, joyful thing, which the movie honors with an affectionate tone and a bunch of sweet moments. I loved the audition sequence, for example, in which six women liberate themselves from shyness, old bones, and overbearing helicopter relatives, and dance their hearts out. And though Weaver (Animal Kingdom) is playing well below her skill set, she goes full throttle as Sheryl, giving the snotty teen squad as good as she gets climbing into bed with her sick friend in spontaneous solidarity, and mothering the team\\'s teen choreographer, played by a charming Alisha Boe. Keaton, effortlessly posh and stylish in her custom uniform of boyfriend-chic, is always a pleasure. But the movie\\'s critical flaw is that Keaton\\'s Martha is the only functioning adult in the room. The rest are wrinkled children, cartoon versions of retirement-village seniors, and it\\'s painful to see a team of our most gifted actresses — Weaver and Weston for sure, but also Pam Grier and Phyllis Somerville, none of whom are past their professional prime — playing gallant old broads, dear old things, or cutesy child-women who lack all specificity beyond the sketched-in personality traits that seem to have been flung at them during storyboarding. Of course POMS isn\\'t meant to be anything but a fantasy in realist clothing. Yet by hitching Martha\\'s imminent death to the innocuous frivolity of a comic cheerleading plot, Hayes and screenwriter Shane Atkinson take on responsibilities they can\\'t follow through on without getting into a tonal and thematic tangle. This is hardly the terrain of Michael Haneke\\'s searing 2012 Amour, but even by the elastic standards of mass-market escapist trifles the creators of POMS might consider the challenges of growing old and confronting death without infantilizing both characters and audience. Martha may be dying, but she\\'s a dying grown-up, which makes it hard to buy the proposition that her fondest bucket-list wish is to fulfill a dream she harbored for a short while in high school. Scene for genial scene POMS is a fitful good time.

Sundance Selects hide caption In Non-Fiction, five characters in search of renewed authorship sit around in more or less fetching Paris locales, holding forth on the state of literature and publishing in the digital age. Will e-readers, and online chatter kill the book as we know it? Do texting and tweeting count as writing? Can fiction survive the age of confessional memoir? Who owns the written word anyway? Oh, and it\\'s a comedy, though writer-director Olivier Assayas is famously loose with genre etiquette and intensely serious about the mysteries of post-post-modern existence. In the opening scenes of Non-Fiction Alain (Guillaume Canet), the dapper and smugly self-possessed publisher of a tony but struggling press, lunches with a long-time author he\\'s about to dump. The writer, Leonard (Vincent Macaigne), is shaggy and insecure — and too busy loading his plate with free food to absorb roundabout hints that his latest \"auto-fiction,\" which draws none too subtly on his many affairs — is being dropped. Never mind that Leonard, who\\'s married to political consultant Valerie (played by French standup comedian Nora Hamzawi), is cavorting with Alain\\'s wife, Selena (Juliette Binoche), a congenitally dissatisfied actress in a television cop show. Or that Alain is sleeping with Laure (Christa Theret), the hot young techie in charge of finessing his company into the digital age. Everyone in this febrile crew is emotionally knocked off center, and with one significant exception they\\'re all living furtive double lives. They never shut up and, true to Assayas form, they aren\\'t asking us to admire or particularly like them. Non-Fiction is a mostly delightful, occasionally exhaustingly word-drunk comedy of manners larded with giddy farce. The tone is light and breezy, and sometimes, for all its bolshie veneer, the movie feels like a sly parody of the ready-for-export French film in which urbane Parisians with glam media jobs swan about, tossing off erudite bons mots about life and lit. Except that here, on the more raggedy margins between bourgeois and boho where beer is drunk rather than Chablis, the running jokes are as likely to reference Taylor Swift and Star Wars as they are Michael Haneke and Adorno. What\\'s more, in their hapless way the characters are genuinely trying to get a bead on a weighty question that Assayas has batted about in many of his movies — how to survive, feel, and create in an age of accelerating technological change. Assayas was pondering the fallout of the digital \"revolution\" (Non-Fiction implies he\\'d approve the quotes) as far back as Demonlover (2002), which turned on corporations duking it out for illegal 3D cyber porn. More recently, Kristen Stewart played Web-savvy but unhappy women chained to their smart phones in Assayas\\'s wonderful Clouds of Sils Maria (2014) and Personal Shopper (2016). Precariously straddling the line between cultural democracy and high culture, the ambivalent creatives in Non-Fiction gas blithely on about the market value of e-readers, blogging and tweeting as \"modern haiku,\" and whether anyone listens to critics (ouch) now that algorithms rule. In fact they\\'re all totally freaked out, not just by the transition to digital that may be shaking publishing to its core, but by the wobbly uncertainty of everything except change itself. Toward the end of Non-Fiction, two couples gather in a lovely seaside cabin for barbecue and bitchy innuendo about their now not-so-hidden histories with each other. All the anxious bed-hopping may add up to much ado about very little; someone is pregnant; the company may not be sold; the public still reads books. Resolution has never been Assayas\\'s game. Presiding with benign amusement over all this striving, this puckish equivocator seems to suggest that we might want to hold our horses about the death of literacy and the end of democracy.

Neon hide caption The opioid crisis looms large over Little Woods, a modest but intensely empathetic first film by writer–director Nia DaCosta. But you won\\'t see lurid footage of bewildered tots hovering near the prone bodies of parents immobilized by Oxycontin. Instead, the movie draws its drama from the underground economy in which the prescription drug crisis thrives, and the perpetual state of emergency lived by residents of former boomtowns faded into ghost towns by recession or corporate flight. DaCosta drops us inside the lives of two estranged sisters banding together to avoid eviction from their late mother\\'s house in the North Dakota backwater of Little Woods. One sibling is a perennial screw-up, the other a resourceful survivor; both temperaments are shaped by the drastically limited choices available to them. The young women are in deep trouble, and as the movie opens they\\'re far from a tight family unit. Deb (played by an oddly cast but capable Lily James) is a single mother who\\'s newly drug-free but pregnant for the second time by her son\\'s deadbeat dad (James Badge Dale). The movie revolves around Deb\\'s adopted sister, Ollie, who\\'s played with understated smarts by Tessa Thompson. Ollie is a practical sort who, over the one week they have to come up with a hefty mortgage payment, mops up her sister\\'s messes. And she does so while attempting to make good on her own past mistakes as a small-time drug dealer who moonlights guiding clients over the border to get illicit health care in Canada. On the cusp of clearing her probation, Ollie scratches out a more legit living in food delivery and tries to extricate herself from the opioid business that turns the otherwise decent people of Little Woods into predators or no-hopers. DaCosta calls her feature debut a modern Western, but that\\'s a bit of a stretch. If anything, Little Woods plays as a quietly feminist thriller with a procedural bent, if that\\'s what you can call the endless grind of trying to stay afloat. The film wrings severe beauty from a desolate landscape of cavernous nocturnal parking lots and rickety plywood interiors. Thematically and visually, Little Woods is of a piece with Courtney Hunt\\'s 2008 Frozen River, Kelly Reichardt\\'s Wendy and Lucy (2008), and Debra Granik\\'s Winter\\'s Bone (2010) — intimate realist dramas with a touch of the Grimm fairytale, made by women about women struggling to rise above lives hemmed in by danger and deprivation. DaCosta\\'s movie is, to the best of my knowledge, the first in this sub-genre to be made by a black woman with a black woman in the lead, and to her credit she doesn\\'t make a big fuss of that fact, or that Ollie is far more competent than her sister. As Ollie and Deb make their way (yes, through a dark forest filled with peril) to the border for one more perilous run, the film touches on topical issues like abortion, reproductive rights and sexual assault. For the most part, though, DaCosta has a light touch: Rather than belabor the sociology, she immerses us in the sisters\\' endless struggle to surmount the multiplying obstacles to their survival. With the exception of one sympathetic black probation officer (Lance Reddick) who\\'s firmly planted in Ollie\\'s corner, it\\'s men — parasitic, predatory, or both — who give the two young women the most grief. If there\\'s a weakness in Little Woods it\\'s a tendency (not unusual in a first film) to have the characters verbalize what DaCosta has already so ably shown us. By the end, no one needs to tell us that \"Your choices are only as good as your options.\" Does the film tie up Ollie and Deb\\'s travails too neatly at the end? Perhaps, but they\\'ve earned themselves something like a happy ending. In any event, DaCosta\\'s next film, for Jordan Peele, is a reboot of Candyman, which will surely take us back to her dark places.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 3924}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2019/04/18/714311754/little-woods-is-grimly-lovely-dark-and-deep?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2019-04-18', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 670, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'A modest but intensely empathetic first film by writer-director Nia DaCosta.'}}\n",

Magnolia Pictures hide caption When they write the bible on the great trolls of history, the Satanic Temple should be on the cover. Founded in 2013 as a poke in the eye of religious conservatism, the organization has since transitioned into a fully sincere spiritual movement itself, one advocating principles of nonviolence, religious pluralism, scientific inquiry, individual liberty and Dungeons & Dragons garb. To date, the temple has attracted thousands of members worldwide, people who see themselves as outcasts disillusioned by traditional spirituality but still searching for a sense of community and purpose in their lives. Like Mormonism before it, Satanism has become a distinctly American religion. And no, they don\\'t really worship evil ... at least, so they claim. Hail Satan? is a richly entertaining new documentary on the Satanic Temple\\'s exploits from director Penny Lane, who has become one of our foremost chroniclers of bizarro Americana. Her debut, Our Nixon, charted an alternative history of the Nixon White House from the eyes of three of the disgraced president\\'s closest aides, while Nuts! spun the salacious tale of a quack doctor who hoodwinked a gullible public into improving its sex drive with surgically implanted goat testicles. Now Lane steps from our weird history into an even weirder present: a time when state capitals are constructing Ten Commandments monuments on public grounds, and lawmakers are increasingly finding more inspiration from religious texts than from the Constitution. Into this moment steps Lucien Greaves (not his real name), an activist for the separation of church and state, frequently clad in all-black shirts and sporting a mischievous grin. Along with the considerably more camera-shy Malcolm Jarry, Greaves co-founded the Satanic Temple (in Salem, Mass., naturally) by co-opting the likeness and imagery of Christianity\\'s biggest, baddest evil figure and applying his own philosophy to the Horned One\\'s symbology. So Satan becomes merely an \"adversary,\" not a villain: a metaphor for questioning any kind of authority. And Eve\\'s munching on the apple is celebrated as the moment the human race decided to embrace knowledge and develop a healthy sense of skepticism. The temple\\'s logic is simple: Whenever a public institution passes a new law on religious freedom grounds, the Satanists believe Satanism should get a cut of it right alongside Christianity and everyone else. So when Florida Gov. Rick Scott signs a bill allowing student-led prayer in public schools, these guys hold a press conference outside the state capitol in Tallahassee, where a horned and cloaked spokesman \"thanks\" the governor on behalf of all the Satanic children who can now pray in school. And when some public schools start offering after-school Bible study clubs, here\\'s \"After School Satan,\" complete with devil-themed coloring books. Lane gets a bit muddled with establishing characters in the early going, hindered by her subjects\\' insistence on pseudonyms. Certain details that informed the organization\\'s principles, like the preexisting separate organization Church of Satan and the \"Satanic Panic\" reactionary purge of the 1990s, get glossed over to spend more time with the temple\\'s punkish stunts. There\\'s a very good moment when performance artist Jex Blackmore, one of Satanism\\'s most prominent faces and former head of the temple\\'s Detroit chapter, pushes things too far in some of her more ghoulish ceremonies (not for the squeamish, these gore-and-nudity-filled sermons are shot like they actually did rise from hell); she essentially becomes excommunicated. More delving into that kind of conflict could have let us see the humans behind the proudly hoisted devil masks. Yet as it is, Hail Satan? still makes for an electric modern theological debate, with First Amendment principles and varied biblical imagery clashing in the public square. Sometimes quite literally. In what becomes the film\\'s strongest narrative, statehouses in Oklahoma and Arkansas move to install those aforementioned Ten Commandments monuments. This, in turn, leads the Satanists to construct their own 8-foot-tall statue of a demonic, goat-headed Baphomet and ask that it be placed alongside the tablets. The showdown builds to one of the wildest moments in any recent documentary: a livestream of a (non-Satanist) free-speech activist mowing down the Ten Commandments with his car as he bellows a very Braveheart-like \"Freeeeeedommmmm!\" Freedom has its price, though. Like every other faith collective with growing pains, the Satanic Temple has had to create a hierarchical structure and lay down set tenets for chapters to follow. It can\\'t risk anyone stepping out of line and giving the devil a bad name. But could it become the very thing its adherents despise: an organized religion? Lane leaves the question dangling in the air, but her film raises so many heady ideas that you\\'ll be clamoring for a Second Book of Satan.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 5122}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2019/04/18/714313859/hail-satan-documentary-examines-protest-group-that-bedevils-religious-conservati?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2019-04-18', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 800, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"A richly entertaining new documentary on the Satanic Temple's exploits from director Penny Lane, who has become one of our foremost chroniclers of bizarro Americana.\"}}\n",

Bleeker Street Media hide caption The terrific young actress Elle Fanning has a still, otherworldly beauty and a quizzical air, as if she just wafted in from some other planet and was baffled by the odd ways of Earth. A wise old soul in a supermodel's body, Fanning might not be the intuitive choice to play an unpopular high school girl with songbird ambitions and no threads to match. Turns out she can sing, dance and handle dialogue in both Brit and Polish — all while projecting a chronically introverted Cinderella vibe, with a wild side yearning to break free. In Teen Spirit, a confident directing debut by actor Max Minghella (The Handmaid's Tale), we meet Fanning's Violet marooned at the poverty-stricken butt end of England's scenic Isle of Wight, tending to goats while secretly performing for a smattering of indifferent barflies in a down-at-heel local pub. Mean girls abound in class; the school choir fails to satisfy; and Violet's harried Polish mother (Agnieszka Grochowska) isn't exactly on board for her daughter's decision to audition for a local song competition. Discouraged, Violet is ready to give up when an unlikely fairy godfather materializes in the amply-bellied form of Vlad (a very good Zlatko Buric), a washed-up opera singer in acute need of spiritual redemption and income, not necessarily in that order. Vlad has smashed his own life to rubble, but in the way of teen dramas he will prove solid in ways that go way beyond teaching Violet how to breathe through a stanza. Others will help her out with her stage presence as much as with her unhelpful fantasies about a father whose absence she can fill up with demonization or with hero worship. True to genre, Violet faces down the usual array of bullies and cheaters; a handsome jerk who threatens to derail her focus; a slick music biz packager waving an iffy contract and nimbly played against type by Rebecca Hall. Still, what Teen Spirit lacks in original premise it makes up for with skillfully mounted ambiance that adds up to a beguiling calling card for Minghella, who comes in blessed with killer cinematic genes. His father was the late Anthony Minghella (The English Patient and Truly, Madly, Deeply), and Max harnesses his dad's gift for breathing romance into the dreariest habitat, which he retools into his own generational idiom with music-video energy and an eclectic soundtrack, by turns jaunty and wistful, that stretches from Annie Lennox to Ariana Grande and Katy Perry. It's Fanning, though, who retains the sweetness of this heavily-trodden teen fable without ever tipping it over into cloying goo. Now 21 years old, Fanning has been acting since she was three years old. In vastly divergent roles such as the poorly mothered British teen in Sally Potter's Ginger & Rosa (2012), feisty Princess Aurora in Robert Stromberg's 2014 Maleficent, and a sexed-up minx in Sofia Coppola's 2017 The Beguiled, Fanning has always exuded a signature restrained gravity that hints at much internal ado. Here, too, she pays out an ambiguity that keeps us wondering, and not a little anxious, about the inner tensions that both stymie this young woman and propel her forward from shy caterpillar to resplendent butterfly. Always on her own terms, Violet releases the necessary exhibitionist in her slowly and with something approaching reluctance. She's a winner, but the movie leaves us with just enough openness in Violet's destiny to make me imagine what depth Fanning might bring to a movie about a pop star trying to deal with flaming out rather than winning. Vox Lux, perhaps, only without the shouting.\", 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 3709}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/711834543/teen-spirit-smells-like-a-quirky-beguiling-hit?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2019-04-11', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 622, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"It's Fanning... who retains the sweetness of this heavily-trodden teen fable without ever tipping it over into cloying goo.\"}}\n",

IFC hide caption In his first narrative feature, Diane, the critic and documentary filmmaker Kent Jones (Hitchock/Truffaut) comes in praise of older women, the crankier the better. The troubled New England woman at the center of his drama seems at first to embody a familiar type: the fussy old enabler without a life of her own. But Jones proves a loving, if clear-eyed world-builder who invites us into the orbit of a woman muddling through a complicated life, rather than peddling a tactfully edited \"senior\" identity. It\\'s a world he knows with intimate particularity. A fictional composite of the women who peopled Jones\\'s childhood in the Berkshires, Diane (Mary Kay Place) is lined and worn and unobtrusive, the kind of older woman to whom you probably wouldn\\'t give a second glance on the street. But though I can think of other actresses who would do credit to the role of an invisible woman with a seething inner life — Annette Bening or Kathy Bates, for starters — no one can drab down her physical self while projecting inner tumult quite like Place. As the over-involved mother of a drug-addicted grown son, the actress projects a bewildered resignation that slowly escalates into impotent rage. When she\\'s not driving the wintry back roads of New England to deliver casseroles to sick friends, Diane is a textbook enabler who can\\'t stop herself from stocking up the fridge, the coffers, and anything else that her son, Brian, can\\'t or won\\'t manage for himself. For his part Brian (ably rendered by Jake Lacy, whom you might have seen doing something altogether different as a wholesome love interest in 2015\\'s Obvious Child) remains vocally ungrateful for services rendered, to the point of calling his mother a sexual organ. You may sympathize a little: His mother has the classic enabler\\'s habit of railing at her son even as she continues to baby him into sullen paralysis. This is Diane\\'s story, though, and with a bleakly beautiful sense of place and a moody score, Diane slowly and with strategic repetition builds her a rich inner universe and a vibrantly testy community of friends and family. She can\\'t stop serving them either, but though hers may be a grim existence, the tone is far from glum. Jones\\'s crisp dialogue is at its mordantly funniest when Diane gets together with the friends she\\'s known forever (it would spoil the fun if I named the movie\\'s terrific vintage female ensemble), a bunch of witty, fractious storytellers reliving their collective past, roaring at their own bawdy jokes, robustly dredging up old grudges — and falling into tactful silence when Brian\\'s name crops up. Again and again, Diane shows up in her son\\'s chaotically filthy den. Over and over, she is rebuffed or extorted until, at last, something happens to shift the neurotic power nexus that keeps this symbiotic pair unwillingly joined at the hip. Toward the end of Diane, a secret is aired (without resorting to flashbacks) that turns out to mask a bigger reveal that involves Diane\\'s guilt over a long-ago perceived sin. Its fallout has spread like a malign ink stain through both their lives, stunting the ability of both to move ahead. Brian will set Diane straight about her errors of judgment, but this isn\\'t the kind of movie where insight sends mother and son into a rosy sunset. \"This time\\'s different,\" a cleaned-up Brian insists, and you\\'d be right to murmur \"maybe\" under your breath. But the fundamentalist church that keeps him sober can never bring solace to a skeptic like Diane. Instead, Jones fills her existential space with a bracing, though never unfeeling, inquiry into what it feels like to confront the steady drip of accumulating pain, and loss, and no longer being needed as we age. If that makes Diane sounds like a heaping pile of misery, it\\'s anything but.

Sony Pictures Classics hide caption Some mighty fancy millinery plays a key role in the Hungarian film Sunset. The hats are ornate and beautiful and way over the top, all of which might also be said of the paper-thin grandeur of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1913 as it teeters on the verge of collapse just before the outbreak of World War I. Budapest, the crown jewel of that empire, also teems with anarchists, cultists, con men, strongmen and all manner of unsavory types who reliably rush in to fill a social vacuum, all working under the radar of bourgeois decorum as the city feverishly prepares to celebrate a jubilee. We watch things fall apart through the vigilant eyes of a young woman in the eye of the storm, who may end up connecting the dots for us between fine millinery and toxic civilization. Then again, the film\\'s director, Laszlo Nemes (Son of Saul) is not given to connecting dots — at least not so\\'s you\\'d notice up front. At an upscale hat store catering to the local rich as well as high-ups from Vienna — Budapest\\'s rival in wealthy excess — we meet Irisz Leiter (Juli Jakab), an elegantly dressed stranger with piercing blue eyes, who arrives at the shop ostensibly looking for work. She gets a distinctly cool welcome from the owner, Mr. Brill, a smooth operator played by Vlad Ivanov, whom you may remember as the reptilian abortionist in the Romanian film 4 Months, 3 Weeks & 2 Days. When he hears that Irisz is the daughter of the store\\'s previous proprietors, who perished there in a mysterious fire years ago, Brill tries to run her out of town. Irisz digs in her heels, so he switches gears and adds her to the team of gorgeous women he has hand-picked, seemingly to make hats for an upcoming royal visit from Vienna. They don\\'t know it, but the girls are being groomed for something far creepier and more cultish than a party. The rot starts at the top, and adding to the mystery is a downtrodden Countess (Julia Jakubowska), whose dead husband may have been murdered by a brother Irisz never knew she had, who\\'s either dead or spearheading a brewing insurrection in Budapest\\'s dark netherworld. Sunset is unsettlingly devoid of exposition, foreshadowing or any other tricks that flag where a complicated narrative might be going. If anything, Nemes means to immerse us in the stew of malignant ambiguity that threatens to engulf Irisz as she tries to unravel the tissue of secrets and lies that surrounds her parents\\' deaths. The film strands us with Irisz as her search leads her from one unreliable lead to another, the background always blurry and indistinct. A hand-held camera clings to her retreating back as she commutes between light and darkness, between the overripe opulence of the store, the streets bright with festive celebrants, and the dank corners of the city. There, a bearded mystery man tells Irisz, plans are afoot to make sure that \"blood will flow in these streets.\" Nemes can be relentlessly opaque, which at time makes the film a drag to follow. But there\\'s method in his determination to leave us with nowhere to park our own affinities. He\\'s showing us the soil in which fascism takes root, and in this sense Sunset operates as a kind of prequel to the director\\'s 2015 Son of Saul, which confronts the horror of the Nazi concentration camps through the eyes of a Sonderkommando prisoner whose job is to rip valuables from the bodies of his gassed fellow Jews. Sunset catches a moment when spreading unease and dysfunction threaten to tip over into apocalypse, a war without heroes. There\\'s a touch of the fanatic or the avenging angel in Irisz, too, in her implacable refusal to give way or give up. Nemes is not one to announce parallels between then and now. But the movie\\'s final scene makes it impossible not to see a warning in Irisz\\'s implacable stare into the camera from a wartime dugout. The victim has, perhaps, grown into a radical leader. Only we don\\'t know what kind. A previous version of this story incorrectly said that director Laszlo Nemes\\' movie Son of Saul is from 1915. It\\'s actually from 2015.

The Orchard hide caption Remember Jesse Eisenberg in The Social Network as the callow Harvard undergrad who cooked up a little thingie called Facebook because his girlfriend dumped him? Please welcome back both actor and, more or less, character in The Hummingbird Project, a likably cheeky but rambling and overstuffed hedge-fund romp by Canadian writer-director Kim Nguyen. Representing the legions of tech-billionaire wannabes who toil unsung below the radar, Eisenberg\\'s Vincent Zaleski is a manically oversharing hustler who\\'s peddling a big idea for streamlining the flow of market information while lining his own pockets. We meet Vinnie parked on a bench, chattering like an express train to a taciturn fellow sitting next to him. Pay attention: In an entertaining running visual joke, Vinnie\\'s cousin Anton, a brooding hulk with stooped shoulders and a monk\\'s tonsure, is played — wildly against type — by the incurably pretty Alexander Skarsgård. Though not gifted at human contact, Anton is a math genius who reluctantly allows Vinnie to harness his wizardry with algorithms into a scheme to lay a straight line of fiber-optic cable from Kansas to New Jersey. This, Vinnie is certain, will speed up the already frantic pace of high-frequency trading by one millisecond, which is equal to a single flap of a hummingbird\\'s wings. If you\\'re thinking, welcome to our world, be advised that this is a period piece (meaning circa 2011, which is what passes for history these days) and the technology that drives the action is obsolete as we speak. What follows is a wackadoodle procedural, with Vinnie in the field stomping on the land rights of ordinary Joes who get in his cable\\'s way, while Anton holes up in a hotel room in a ratty old bathrobe, working up algorithms for the theft of proprietary code. Among the frantically plotted obstacles the cousins face, in no particular order, are: nature and weather, Amish and Appalachians, and inevitably, the FBI. None of which comes close to the vengeful trickery of the Zaleskis\\' former boss Eva Torres — a gorgon in power shoulders and murderous stiletto heels played with relish by Salma Hayek — who throws up a trail of microwave towers to counter Vinnie\\'s cable. Nguyen is a skilled farceur, but he doesn\\'t know when to stop. For a film about our obsession with speed, The Hummingbird Project soon bogs down in saggy repeat cycles involving flat tires, unhappy investors, and logistical snafus that even Vinnnie\\'s stalwart engineer (Michael Mando) can\\'t resolve. At which point the movie, already dampened by dingy visuals, veers off into a moral fable with a cancer diagnosis thrown in that makes an uncomfortable fit with the movie\\'s overall jokey tone. As I write, scandals are bubbling up about cheating one percenters in every public sphere from banking to college admissions, and for the sake of perspective it pays to remember that it was Vinnie and his ilk who crashed the economy in 2008. Much of what he does here is unspeakable and inflicts suffering on those around him. Yet Nguyen wants us to think of Vinnie as nothing worse than a socially unskilled scamp whose worst fault is that he thinks of himself as a plucky David among greedy Goliaths. In fact Vinnie\\'s just another of the Goliaths he\\'s trying to outsmart, for whom winning is a prize even above profit. At its best The Hummingbird Project is a parable about failure, but one that ultimately undercuts itself with redeeming goo. What\\'s at the end of the \"line,\" and the line, for Vinnie and Anton? Enlightenment for sure, atonement of course, and an Amish-propelled chastening climax that involves grain sacks, sheds, and the dubious pleasures of simply country living.

Sony Pictures Classics hide caption Midway through All Is True, Kenneth Branagh\\'s imaginary wrangle of the troubled last years of William Shakespeare, a young fan approaches the Bard, who has returned to his native Stratford-upon-Avon to lick old wounds and reinsert himself into the family he has neglected for two decades. The eager visitor wants to know how Shakespeare did it — how he understood so deeply what drove the many disparate kinds of people in his plays. The grumpy playwright pauses his inept efforts to dig a memorial garden and tells the young man that all of it — good, bad, ugly — came from within himself. \"All is true,\" he tells the boy, but when asked why he stopped writing, the aging lion takes umbrage and shoos the hapless fellow off his property. All Is True was Shakespeare\\'s alternate title for his final work, Life of Henry VIII, which was enjoying its first run in 1613 at the Globe when the theatre burned to a crisp. That much we know for sure. In the film, a devastated Shakespeare leaves London and returns to his hometown, and the rest is Branagh\\'s vision, with British screenwriter and comedian Ben Elton, of Will\\'s efforts to come to terms with assorted demons literary, domestic and romantic. A ghost pops in periodically to torment Will, but mostly this is a realist elegy for a flawed man as clueless about the human heart in life as he was wise on the page. Branagh, his nervous, slightly shifty eyes all but lost in a massive dome of a forehead rising off a pointy beard, offers us a tragicomic Shakespeare too anxious, insecure and self-absorbed to register the suffering he has inflicted on his older wife Anne (a nicely quizzical Judi Dench) and daughters, Susanna (Lydia Wilson) and Judith (Kathryn Wilder), all of whom he consigned to the back burner while working to become the world\\'s greatest playwright. Add to that Shakespeare\\'s romantic idealization of his son Hamnet (Sam Ellis), who died at 11 years old and whom he claims as his chip-off-the-poetic-block inspiration, and you have a humbling waiting to happen. Skeletons march smartly out of closets, along with a fountain of secrets and lies and a couple of sex scandals that roil the prissy Puritan community of Stratford. (Windsor, technically, and tranquilly rendered by cinematographer Zac Nicholson in rich colors that shift gently from one season to the next.) The tone is wistful and melancholy, spiced with occasional bursts of antic comedy. Resentments come to the boil, many of them filtered through the bitterly articulate invective of Judith, Hamnet\\'s surviving twin and an acerbic young woman who in many ways is the movie\\'s most vital creation. A smart cookie with no prospects but to marry and produce the grandson her father longs for, Judith emerges as a powerful stand-in for her disenfranchised sex in a movie slyly studded with up-to-date references to gender, race and, above all, class. From Dead Again all the way through Murder on the Orient Express, Branagh\\'s contemporary films always have struck me as the heavy-breathing creations of a man trying much too hard to be someone he isn\\'t. His Shakespeare work as actor and director, by contrast, is deft, calmly unfussy and assured. All Is True is no exception, in part perhaps because Branagh has parlayed the humble origins he shares with the Bard (Branagh is a plumber\\'s son, Shakespeare the offspring of a petty thief) into a study of the lifelong status anxiety that bedevils poor Will. Unlike his mostly upper-crust literary peers who lived large and died of too much booze or sex or both, Branagh\\'s Shakespeare grew into a petty bourgeois who carefully salted away money and property and who, pathetically, ponied up 20 pounds to buy himself a coat of arms. Galloping in to rub salt in that wound is the earl of Southampton, once closeted as the Dark Lady of Shakespeare\\'s ardent sonnets, now an old man played by Ian McKellen with lashings of twinkly camp, who gives his old friend a tongue-lashing for giving up his writing and for living \"a small life.\" We\\'ll never know if that small life really expanded into humility and insight as it does in All Is True, which brings Shakespeare and his family to their knees and then raises them for an incongruous, sweetly sentimental group hug. It hardly matters, for in this lovely ode to a literary master, Branagh shows us what his hero always understood — that life may be an endlessly unfolding mystery, but in art, all is true.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4619}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/12/20/677504517/all-is-true-finds-melancholy-and-magic-in-shakespeare-s-final-years', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-12-20', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 791, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'In this lovely ode to a literary master, Branagh shows us what his hero always understood - that life may be an endlessly unfolding mystery, but in art, all is true.'}}\n",

Liam Daniel/Focus Features hide caption At my all-girls high school in England, history class was basically an ongoing roster of uncivil wars between the Tudors (English) and Stuarts (Scottish) over who would be king of which scept'red British isle. So I knew from bickering royals, though invariably it was all about the men, mostly rascally Henry VIII and his disposable wives, fondly known to us girls as Divorced-Beheaded-Died-Divorced-Beheaded-Survived. Either I was napping at my desk or the formidable Miss Dunlop, our history teacher, never got around to the 16th century's spiciest royal war — the knock-down battle for sovereignty over the English and Scottish thrones between Henry's extremely durable daughter, Queen Elizabeth I, and her cousin Mary, Queen of Scots. In a roaring new drama from British theater director Josie Rourke, both come to us red in tooth, claw, and, in keeping with their genetic lineage, hair. Red is the dominant color in Rourke's sassily feminist reading of that epic struggle. Mary Queen of Scots is not a catfight like Yorgos Lanthimos's The Favourite (now playing), a raucously all-about-Eve take on two scheming minxes vying for the affection of Queen Anne, who ruled over a more unified Britain a century later. Rourke's full-throttle epic is less iconoclastic, less ribald, less devoted to gastric distress and less inclined to use period costume and landscape as farce than is Lanthimos's black comedy. Based on a revisionist biography of Mary Stuart by Dr. John Guy, Mary Queen of Scots surely doesn't lack for moxie. And though Elizabeth — played with a bracing blend of hauteur and uncertainty by Margot Robbie — is the better known of the two monarchs both in and out of the movies, this is very much Mary's story. With a great comb of flaming hair flying off her forehead, Saoirse Ronan's Mary, freshly returned from France to claim her right to the Scottish throne and, she hopes, to succession to the English one, is the objet de lust here, if only because Elizabeth comes all but buried under a coating of pox. Playing cannily against her alabaster delicacy, Ronan gives us a Mary who, though often dismissed by history as promiscuous, runs a proudly sexy court with her frisky ladies-in-waiting and a casually multi-ethnic retinue. The frank libido gets her into all kinds of trouble, notably with the bisexual opportunist Lord Darnley (Jack Lowden), who fathers a significant baby with her. This Mary may be politically unsavvy, but she's not weak, and she pushes right back when the far more seasoned Elizabeth tries to weaken her claim to the throne by proposing she marry Elizabeth's faithful aide and possible lover, Robert Dudley (Joe Alwyn). The air around Mary and Elizabeth fairly bristles with machination, some of it their own, much of it the work of an army of entertainingly appalling male schemers for civil war. Notable among them are David Tennant as the viciously misogynist Scottish prelate John Knox, wild of eye and sporting a ratty beard that looks ready to sprout writhing serpents, and Guy Pearce in an unflattering pageboy, valiantly wrestling his Aussie diction into posh BBC syllables as Elizabeth's devoted but ruthless adviser Lord William Cecil. History has it that Elizabeth and Mary never actually met, though they may have exchanged letters. In the movie they do, after a fashion, and in that movie scene they express anger, envy, ambivalence, and hunger for sisterly solidarity. It's possible that, in making a case for an uneasy, ambivalent sisterhood, Rourke presses too heavily on the contemporary relevance pedal. This is far from a girlie movie: Neither woman has the temperament or the appetite for victimhood, an Rourke doesn't stint on the brutal action scenes. Mary Queen of Scots does make a powerfully moving case for an uneasy dance between two powerful women hamstrung by male politics. Only one of them knows how to play that game herself; she will survive and even flourish in one of the longest reigns in the history of English monarchy. But the price paid by the winner will be almost as heavy as that exacted on the loser, who will go on to win her own victory from the grave, uniting Britain under one ruler at last.\", 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4342}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/12/06/673313454/in-mary-queen-of-scots-2-queens-become-pawns-in-a-struggle-for-supremacy?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-12-06', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 726, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'Mary Queen of Scots does make a powerfully moving case for an uneasy dance between two powerful women hamstrung by male politics.'}}\n",

Strand Releasing hide caption In 1993, twelve-year-old Giuseppe di Matteo was kidnapped and held in brutal captivity to put pressure on his father, a Mafia informer, to stop unburdening himself to prosecutors about the Sicilian mob. Sicilian Ghost Story, written and directed by Fabio Grassadonia and Antonio Piazza, wraps a bleakly realist account of young Giuseppe's three-year ordeal into a kind of memorial — by way of a love story, which itself unfolds in a fairy tale more Grimm than Disney. Inspired by a short story about the kidnapping by Marco Mancassola, this intensely atmospheric melodrama opens cheerfully with Giuseppe (Gaetano Fernandez) dawdling along the way to school in his Sicilian village, when he suddenly veers left into dark woods. There, he's soon followed by his classmate Luna (Julia Jedlikowska). Luna carries a letter which Giuseppe snatches and laughingly refuses to give back. The two make a charmingly flirty pair, innocent and trusting and bonded by their love of woodland creatures (expect no tweety-birds here, but there's a baby owl to die for) but both exude a hint of the rebel. The mood is tender and teasing: the letter's a declaration of love; a kiss will come. But first Giuseppe must rescue Luna from a snarling black dog who races in from nowhere, an early portent of savagery to come. The two arrange to meet at the stables where he keeps his horse. Giuseppe doesn't show up there, or in school thereafter. Grownups start making excuses, and Luna falls into a deep funk — but not too deep to prevent her from drafting her sassy best friend, Loredana (Corinne Musallari), to the search for her beau. There's no hope of help from Luna's loving but passive father (Vincenzo Amato) or from her Swiss mother (Sabine Timoteo), a hard-faced disciplinarian with a Mrs. Danvers vibe and an excess of social ambition. From local officials and a police force openly embedded with the Mafia, there's only a thundering silence concerning Giuseppe's whereabouts. Co-directors Grassadonia and Piazza make effectively sparing use of visceral realism to underline the vicious brutality of the mob. But the movie runs the full register of emotion under extremity through a misty lyricism whose landscape — gnarly trees, dripping caves, nocturnal torches flashing out messages of resistance backed by plaintive ambient noise and a mournful soundtrack — evokes the traumatized spirits of those who haunt it. Gliding between Giuseppe's trapped plight and Luna's own imprisonment within her fevered dreams (which involve meeting her lover in the bottomless lake that bridges their separate worlds), the film elides all boundaries between reality and fantasy, between sanity and a madness brought on by grief. Luna, too, is in danger of extinction. As the sense of emergency grows, the story grows an urgent underlying hum of tacit accusation against a Sicily whose older generation has given up the ghost and retreated into passivity or open collusion with the gangsters who terrorize their lives and, worse, their children. There's only one adult who's willing to help Luna find her friend, and she is frozen by sorrow. The question for Luna and Giuseppe is who will save whom, and it is partly answered in the hopefulness of a seaside sequence by the sea. The dead live on in memory; joy returns by way of a ghostly white knight. These rebel kids will be all right.\", 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 3519}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/11/29/670836999/in-sicilian-ghost-story-a-boy-goes-missing-and-a-girl-goes-searching', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-11-29', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 583, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': '[An] intensely atmospheric melodrama...'}}\n",

Strand Releasing hide caption In Postcards From London, a lovely piece of whimsy about gay life in a bygone London, Harris Dickinson plays Jim, an innocent who leaves the wilds of Essex (translation: London suburb often associated with dull-and-boring) for the metropolis in search of fame and adventure. Winding up in a nostalgically refurbished Soho from before the sleek corporate types moved in, the eager teen suffers the usual big city roughing-up. His luck improves when he\\'s hired by The Raconteurs, a group of young male escorts who specialize in brainy after-sex conversation about the arts. Go ahead, giggle. Among other responses, writer-director Steve McLean wants you to get as playful as he does about his nocturnal fantasy, harking back to the 1970s when Soho was the haunt of artists like Lucian Freud, Derek Jarman and McLean himself. All manner of wacky stuff attends Jim\\'s apprenticeship as a gay muse to older, arty and well-heeled clients. Here\\'s a taste: An Ancient-Rome-obsessed client in a toga eats cheeseburgers in a cheap motel. Jim\\'s professional headshot has him hefting a fruit basket, a nod not only in the direction of his beloved Caravaggio, who (played by Ben Cura) appears in a dream sequence to gripe that \"no one ever asks Caravaggio if he\\'s having a nice day.\" Dickinson, whom you may remember as the confused baby gay in Eliza Hittman\\'s 2017 Beach Rats, has a face ready made to play any Candide soldiering through a cruel world. But though Jim\\'s beauty takes London\\'s gay underworld by storm, he\\'s more than a seraphic face atop an Adonis body. Soon we find him and his new pals, each in his rent-boy shop front, industriously studying up on art history. The Raconteurs are a casually international, multi-ethnic bunch who burst into song and dance as needed and who busy themselves, like a pack of cheery Snow White dwarfs, rebranding their new recruit as a star. Sex is as much part of the service package as painting, and Jim is fully on board. But there\\'s a snag: He suffers from Stendhal Syndrome, an affliction that causes him to faint dead away in the proximity of genuine works of art. While out cold, he dreams he\\'s a character in the painting, nattering away to the supporting cast, also in robes\\'n\\'things. Highly stylized (the film was shot entirely on a sound stage) and tricked out in neon reds and blues that restore Soho to its former tawdry grandeur, this is McLean\\'s first feature since Postcards from America, his well-received 1994 adaptation of the writings of New York painter David Wojnarowicz. Like that film, Postcards From London is episodic in structure, which makes the story ramble here and there. For all its air of improvised jauntiness, this is a film of many moods with a haunting score by Julian Bayliss. (Jonah Hauer-King, who plays the head Raconteur, gives a soulful rendition of \"My Funny Valentine.\") McLean\\'s nostalgia for the Soho of Francis Bacon, Freud, and Jarman (all of them clear influences on his own work) is touchingly wistful about the ravages of time, and he\\'s serious about probing the mixed blessings of sex, art, beauty and authenticity. Sex and art get equal time the Raconteurs\\' service package, whose mission is to brighten clients\\' post-coital tristesse and alleviate urban ennui. When Jim models for an older artist (Richard Durden) from the Francis Bacon era, he discovers that becoming a muse is both less and more than it\\'s cracked up to be. Given his illness, it\\'s also only a matter of time before Jim falls into more pernicious hands. A money-grubbing art forger (Leemore Marrett Jr.) tries to harness his talents for a creative business opportunity, and Jim is brought to reconsider art as just about any work that converts life into imagination, including a bunch of creatively rearranged cardboard boxes that somebody calls home. That little shock of the new, in turn, will bring new ways of seeing about whom Jim gets to call friend.

Focus Features hide caption Based on a 2016 memoir by Garrard Conley, Boy Erased is the second movie this year — after last August\\'s The Miseducation of Cameron Post — to focus on so-called gay conversion therapy centers, where LGBTQ teens are sent to be, as their mostly evangelical parents see it, straightened out. Both films are worth your time; both, in their way, are intelligent message movies that refuse to hide their outrage at a repressive practice that, as a coda before the Boy Erased end credits informs, 36 American states still allow. What\\'s interesting is that neither film shakes an accusing finger at the parents or, for that matter, at Christian belief per se. That said, neither film lets parents or their substitutes off the hook for seeking to radically alter and deny who their charges are, just because the elders are convinced the Bible tells them so. Both films are about the vulnerability of teens whose parents willingly consign them to the \"care\" of dubiously qualified saviors lugging their own unexamined baggage of guilt and self-loathing. Boy Erased is also Lucas Hedges\\' second turn as a teenaged boy who\\'s uncertain of his sexual identity. The talented young actor projects the same ingenuous bewilderment he brought to his role as Saoirse Ronan\\'s first love in last year\\'s Lady Bird. Only here he\\'s not playing for laughs. After an incident at his college in the rural American South, young Jared Eamons is forced to come out to his loving parents, Marshall (Russell Crowe) and Nancy (Nicole Kidman). Crushed and taking instruction from congregation elders, they dispatch their bemused but compliant son to Love in Action, a center devoted to refitting novice young LGBTQ\\'s for the heterosexual path. There awaits ritual humiliation and invasive scrutiny by \"carers,\" some of them closeted homosexuals turning their self-loathing outward, some religious fanatics, all of them certain that the indignities they inflict on their vulnerable charges are all in a day\\'s faith-based work. At the helm is Victor Sykes (Joel Edgerton), a sincere dufus bent on rooting out what he sees as the single cause of homosexuality — the Bad Dad. Sykes is not a violent man, but he\\'s not too bright — Boy Erased proves readier than Cameron Post to sidetrack into comic relief — and he\\'s weak enough to delegate power to the one unalloyed bad egg in this scenario, a tattooed enforcer who can barely contain his instinctive sadism. He\\'s played with relish by the Red Hot Chili Peppers\\' Flea. Maybe it\\'s a little cuckoo that this ineluctably Southern-accented movie features Flea (who was born in Australia) alongside a cast and crew heavily stocked from Down Under. There\\'s Kidman and Crowe, of course, as well as Edgerton, who wrote and directed Boy Erased and smoothly handles the tonal shifts between absurd and sinister as the film slides between Jared\\'s past and present struggles. Crowe is terrific as Jared\\'s father Marshall, a car dealer and pastor who has staked his world on a literalist reading of the Bible and cannot bring himself to confront, much less accept, his beloved son\\'s sexuality. As Jared\\'s mother Nancy, a vision in a blond \\'do and sparkly cardies, a spry Kidman carries both the movie\\'s wry humor, and its humanity. Also notable are the great Cherry Jones as a lone voice of sanity in Jared\\'s ear; Britton Sear as a hulking football player run to seed and sinking fast under the humiliations showered on him at Love in Action; singer Troye Sivan as an enigmatic fellow inmate who shows Jared that his instinctive eagerness to please may become his worst enemy; and Theodore Pellerin as the soulful mentor any parent should wish for to guide their child into adult sexuality. In the end, though, Jared must chart his own future, and it\\'s not incidental that what jolts him into action is the attempt to turn him against his own family. Not all the inmates of Love in Action will be so lucky, and not all those who seek to remodel them will be capable of change. To find out which is which, do stay for the end credits. There, in addition to the photo-snippets of the real Garrard Conley (a movie cliché I hold very dear), you will learn what became of Victor Sykes.

Bleeker Street hide caption \\'Tis the season, in movie-world, to run the family-dysfunction tape on a loop. If you tire easily of snickering variants on Home For the Holidays, let me recommend What They Had, a finely textured family drama deceptively wrapped in that overworked subgenre. I doubt writer-director Elizabeth Chomko even thought of building her impressive debut feature around the reductive term \"dysfunction,\" a noxiously bullying word that feeds the fantasy of a smoothly operative family somewhere out there in Perfectsville, where none of us lives. Chomko brings sympathy, tender goofiness and a fine sense of wintery place to the predicament of a Chicago family struggling through a worsening crisis as its matriarch, Ruth (Blythe Danner) sinks further into Alzheimer\\'s disease. Actually she neither sinks nor disappears — not really. Seeded by Chomko\\'s own grandmother\\'s slide in and out of dementia, this familiar setup has the intimate, lived-in immediacy of autobiography. The mood is funny and sad but never mawkish, and Danner, clearly relishing the opportunity not to have to serve up yet another tastefully garbed maternal super-WASP, renders the still sprightly Ruth with a nice edge of antic, like a slightly tranquilized Anne Meara. Ill or not, Ruth remains an indomitable soul even when she\\'s hazy about her relationship to the family members gathering in the home she shares with her husband, Burt (Robert Forster). A plainspoken Midwesterner to his core, the devoted but irascible Burt bristles at the suggestion that it may be time to move Ruth into assisted living, a proposal tendered in vastly different registers by his children, Bridget (Hilary Swank), an unhappily married Californian chef who has power of attorney for her parents, and Nicky (Michael Shannon), a blustery bar owner who chafes at the everyday grind of caring for their parents. At the outset Bridget is tactful and compliant; Nicky\\'s a shouter. Burt digs his heels in; Ruth wanders the snowy streets in her nightie. Along for the ride is Bridget\\'s daughter (Taissa Farmiga), in full flight from the college life her working class family so prizes. A powder keg waiting to blow, the family fights over old history and fresh trouble, with home-movie footage reliably flashing back to what they had in (possibly) happier days. So far, so by the book. But Chomko, expertly handling her jewel of an ensemble, resists devolving the action into runaway farce or tragedy. If on paper these seem like stock characters checking the usual boxes of domestic dramedy — divorce, parenting, sibling rivalry, aging and illness, the legacy of the overbearing patriarch — Chomko refreshes the formula with vividly grounded writing that never forces her actors to summarize where they\\'ve been, emotionally speaking, or where they\\'re going. \"Just don\\'t get how you get,\" Bridget chides her brother, in the shorthand of adult siblings regressing into childhood squabbles. Everyone goes a little bit gaga as, individually and collectively, this family melts down in slow increments of repressed anger, pain, and haplessness as they inch toward reassessing a well-worn groove of power and rebellion none of them has ever paused to comprehend because they\\'ve been so busy coping in the moment. If there is inspirational growth here — and there is — no one goes all I-can-see-clearly-now on us. The small but significant shifts that bring them more in sync come to a head in a lovely grace note when Nicky slowly, carefully mixes a Manhattan for his father. Burt responds in Burt-fashion, only with a healing difference that tells us this family isn\\'t failing. It\\'s trying, which may be as good as family gets.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 3829}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/10/18/657022922/a-family-in-quiet-crisis-gathers-to-assess-what-they-had-and-what-they-ve-still-', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-10-18', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 617, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"Chomko refreshes the formula with vividly grounded writing that never forces her actors to summarize where they've been, emotionally speaking, or where they're going.\"}}\n",

Thomas Scott Stanton/The Orchard hide caption Like many in the stand-up world, Nina Geld (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a comedian whom we meet working the edgier comedy clubs of New York City, is angry. When she's not riffing on menstrual blood and other female troubles nobody else wants to talk about, her potty-mouthed monologues are studded with the case against men, which earns her appreciative laughs from young audiences both male and female. Nina is poised, articulate, funny and unsparing — none of which prevents her from throwing up after every performance. Or from carrying on an affair with Joe (Chase Crawford), a married cop whose fists fly with or without provocation. The fact that Joe is the only man she's ever allowed to be with her more than once is rooted in Nina's torn-from-the-headlines past. Yet All About Nina, written and directed by Spanish-born, New York-based Eva Vives, wears it topicality lightly. We live in the moment with Nina not because she doesn't understand the history that's burning her up, but because she suppresses it in order to stay upright and function. Also, not incidentally, because she loves her work and she's ambitious enough to move to Los Angeles to audition for the television show Comedy Prime. Angelenos, myself included, may sigh and wish that, just for once in a film made by a New Yorker, a transplant to L.A. isn't immediately made to shack up with a wacky New-Ager who makes strangely-colored juices in a blender and ropes her into attending a fundraiser for stray cats. Mercifully, Vives is a sharp writer who knows how to flesh out character, and the Mexican actress Kate del Castillo, who projects wit and warmth as Nina's hippie host, Lake, has excellent comic timing. Lake also has a briskly no-nonsense way with her houseguest's gift for self-sabotage, and she's not the only new friend who stands ready to help Nina loosen her tightly controlled grip on her unprocessed fury. But the movie is carried by Winstead's mesmerizingly mercurial performance, and not just because she does pitch-perfect impressions of, among others, Kristen Stewart and Werner Herzog. Her Nina burns with ambition and she's incandescent with rage, but she's also terrified and paralyzed by anxiety and fear. All About Nina is far from the first movie to be set on the comedy club circuit. But it's one of only a few (1968's Funny Girl, 1988's Punchline, and Gillian Robespierre's 2014 Obvious Child, among others) to focus on female comedians. There's richer world-building here though, and the movie has some wonderfully raucous scenes featuring real-life women stand-ups and a really funny cameo by the British-Japanese actress Sonoyo Mizuno as a disgruntled ex of Nina's promising new squeeze. Like Obvious Child, All About Nina insists on women's right to unfiltered anger, to profanity and a filthy mind, to sexual desire outside of a committed relationship. Like Robespierre's movie, though, Vives packages the raunch and the rage in a traditional (if nonchalantly cross-racial) romance that feels both satisfying and a touch glib. Until she meets Rafe (rap artist Common), a building contractor with a velvet voice and a checkered past of his own, Nina has muddled through on the assumption that men exist only as sexual predators on whom she must turn the tables and dismiss. Unlike Nina, Rafe has parlayed his troubles into hard-won decency and a willingness to go slow in early dating, none of which detracts from the movie's frank carnality or the challenging fact that, with Rafe as with any other man she's known, Nina is the sexual aggressor. Obstacles will come, and a crisis point that leads to a new monologue in Nina's repertoire and a dose of truth-telling that, even in edgy indies, sets troubled lovers free at the 90-minute mark.

A24 hide caption As she moves through middle age, there\\'s a whiff of acid in every Emma Thompson performance that adds a lively bump to the actress\\'s Stateside image as an eternally flowering English Rose. The bracing asperity that juiced Thompson\\'s self-directed turn as a warty governess in Nanny McPhee, as a bigoted headmistress in An Education, as the neurotic Mary Poppins author P. L. Travers in Saving Mr. Banks, now pops up in more subtle guise in The Children Act, a near-fatally tasteful British drama adapted by Ian McEwan from his 2014 novel and directed by Richard Eyre. We meet the cranky but humane High Court judge Fiona Maye — My Lady, to those who serve her — as she prepares to try the case of seventeen-year-old Adam (Dunkirk\\'s Fionn Whitehead), a Jehovah\\'s Witness with leukemia who has refused a life-saving blood transfusion on religious grounds. His devout parents (Ben Chaplin and Eileen Walsh) support Adam\\'s decision, but British law is quite clear about what\\'s supposed to happen when a minor\\'s life is in danger, even from himself. So what looks to become a courtroom drama about the battle between State authority and religious freedom soon takes a sharp turn into more personal wars when Judge Maye puts her ruling on hold while she visits Adam in the hospital to try to gauge his reasoning. This is highly irregular behavior, and becomes a lot more so when we find My Lady singing a bedside Yeats poem, with the sensitive defendant accompanying her on a battered guitar. Thereafter she finds herself stalked by an apparently recovered Adam, who\\'s now legally an adult and who believes Fiona is the answer to all the outstanding life questions his proletarian parents can\\'t cope with. We\\'re invited to believe that too: Discreet class snobbery courses through every reverential swing of the camera around Fiona\\'s apartment upholstered in gracious greys; every zoom over her elegantly tailored black frocks, power suits; every scene of her rehearsing with a colleague for a Bach piano recital. Fiona reeks of culture and refinement, while Adam\\'s working-class parents, on the other hand, don\\'t exist outside their fundamentalist beliefs. The bad faith lies less with them than with a film that airbrushes them out of the elegant picture. Never mind that Fiona\\'s devotion to her work has all but destroyed her own personal life. She barely notices the frustration of her loving husband (Stanley Tucci), who early on announces — understandably, if improbably — that since they haven\\'t made love in a year, he\\'s about to embark on an affair. The couple has no children. And having reached out to Adam in violation of protocol, Fiona proceeds to repel — with telling ambivalence — every effort by the earnest teen to burrow under her skin. When he succeeds anyway, she suffers internal commotion on the grand scale. Meaning, she runs out on a Christmas recital to visit Adam. When that backfires, she walks through the rain weeping while ruining a very lovely emerald evening gown. Easy comfort awaits. What has brought Fiona to this parlous state? Did she offer the boy too much or too little? Is she in love or in egregious loco parentis? It\\'s hard to tell and harder to care, not least because the judge\\'s breakdown comes long after the movie has begun a long, slow slide into bathetic inconsequence that can\\'t be stemmed by Thompson\\'s modulated restraint or the excellent backup she gets from Tucci and the usual assemblage of terrific British actors. So parched of saving humor is the film that one wants to extract every moment of comic joy from the great character actor Jason Watkins as Fiona\\'s meticulous assistant, inevitably named Nigel. \"Have you ever been wild and free, Nigel?\" inquires his workaholic boss? \"No, never, My Lady,\" the startled factotum deadpans. \"Thank God.\" The problem lies less with Eyre\\'s smooth directing than with the attenuated material, adapted from a rather anodyne novel that\\'s far from McEwan\\'s best. The movie is of a piece with the director\\'s capable mid-career films (Iris, Notes on a Scandal), none of which has ever bettered his wonderful 1983 debut feature, The Ploughman\\'s Lunch. McEwan scripted that political drama too, and it\\'s hard to square his densely witty screenplay there with the clanging bombast of The Children Act, which is studded with statements of intent (\"I\\'m going to have an affair\") or import (\"I left this marriage for two days. You left this marriage years ago\"), or throwaway lines that airily dispose of significant subtexts (\"Just too busy to have children\"). Characters move through their posh habitats, explaining what they\\'ve done, are about to do, should have done years ago. Their confusion is fine; the fuzziness of the filmmaking less so. At once wan and self-important, The Children Act dances around the psychological complication and philosophical depth that have brought some of McEwan\\'s other novels such renown along with the best of the films they\\'ve inspired, like Enduring Love and Atonement. Is the film an inquiry into reason versus faith? The divorce of thought from feeling in a woman who has lost her bearings? In a movie so beautifully dressed and well-mannered, it feels almost churlish to ask if maybe the empress wears no clothes.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 5336}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/09/13/647068394/in-the-wan-airless-the-children-act-a-judge-shows-poor-judgment', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-09-13', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 889, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"Characters move through their posh habitats, explaining what they've done, are about to do, should have done years ago.

Valeria Florini/MGM hide caption For a drama about the capture of one of the most notorious architects of the Holocaust, Chris Weitz\\'s Operation Finale begins with a bit of a caper. A crack team of Mossad agents, on a tip from a young Jewish woman (Haley Lu Richardson), bungle the job by bringing down the wrong Nazi. Shrugging off their error, the unit, headed by Peter Malkin (Oscar Isaac) forges ahead to snag the real Adolf Eichmann as he\\'s walking home through a leafy Buenos Aires suburb. Needless to say, he\\'s played by Ben Kingsley; so also needless to say, he is seriously unflapped. Though it\\'s framed as a thriller, Operation Finale isn\\'t much of an action picture. Not that it needs to be: That ground has already been covered by at least three television movies about Eichmann\\'s brazen 1960 abduction from under the noses of an Argentine police force heavily indebted to a flourishing local community of German fascist ex-pats. And though Weitz has worked comfortably with and without his brother Paul in a bunch of genres (American Pie, a Twilight movie, and the wonderful dramedy About a Boy), here the director seems ill-at-ease with the tight structure and staccato rhythms of the thriller. The action scenes are slackly paced and weighed down by an abundance of glibly realized secondary characters standing in for old and new generations in a fledgling State of Israel. Lior Raz, from the Netflix series Fauda, is manlier than thou as Isser Harel, the real-life Mossad director who planned the capture. Melanie Laurent is wasted as an Israeli doctor whose chief function is to stick needles in the prisoner while making goo-goo eyes at Malkin (her ex, but they\\'re split). And British actor Simon Russell Beale, so marvelous as Beria in the recent The Death of Stalin, pops in with a fuzz of important hair as Israeli Prime Minister David Ben Gurion to underline the historical import of catching Eichmann. But it\\'s Isaac\\'s Malkin, loosely based on a real-life team leader, who personifies an Israel still raw fifteen years after the trauma of the Holocaust. The movie is littered with flashbacks imagining possible deaths for Malkin\\'s sister, about whom all he knows is that she perished in a forest with her children, conceivably on Eichmann\\'s orders. Claude Lanzmann, whose magisterial documentary Shoah is the nearest thing we have to a definitive account of the Holocaust, would likely have hated the reductive Hollywood shorthand in which avenging his sister\\'s death is Malkin\\'s reason for bringing Eichmann to trial. Yet it\\'s in the movie\\'s lengthy middle sequence of verbal sparring between Malkin and Eichmann that Operation Finale comes into its own. During a ten-day flight delay, Malkin must coerce or persuade Eichmann to sign off on his willingness to be transported to Israel to face what he regards as a show trial. Kingsley has spent most of his career honing a variety of sphinxes, and here he shifts the mask around adroitly as Eichmann, after insisting that he\\'s just a prosperous businessman named Ricardo Klement, switches gears to advance the infamously slippery claim that he was not a monster but merely a cog in the Final Solution machine, \"chained to my desk twenty hours a day.\" That won\\'t wash with Malkin, no mean dissembler himself. Their quietly lethal war of words (Matthew Orton\\'s screenplay comes to vivid life here), bolstered by flashbacks of Eichmann\\'s active participation in the execution of his orders, foreshadows the real-life trial we glimpse only with the end credits, where the notion that Eichmann was merely a bureaucrat following orders was forcefully demolished. To its credit, Operation Finale also offers a rebuke to the sentimental but commonly held notion that the Nazis were an inhuman aberration. In the sheer range of his capacities, from worrying about the safety of his family to presiding over a blueprint for the obliteration of an entire people, Kingsley\\'s Eichmann shows himself all too human, a monster among other genocidal monsters who came before and after him. One only wishes that the movie had not undermined this painful truth by resorting to the vulgar bromide that, having dispatched one source of the trauma inflicted on the Jewish people, its victims experienced closure.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4365}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/08/30/642658155/to-catch-a-nazi-operation-finale-is-more-a-talker-than-a-thriller', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-08-30', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 720, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"It's in the movie's lengthy middle sequence of verbal sparring between Malkin and Eichmann that Operation Finale comes into its own.\"}}\n",

Greenwich Entertainment hide caption In 1978, embarking on a career at the ripe age of 58 that would earn her a raft of literary prizes, the British novelist Penelope Fitzgerald published a wonderfully tragicomic tale, short-listed for the Booker prize, about a 1950s middle-aged war widow who wakes up one day and decides to open a bookstore in her fog-bound East Anglian fishing village. The Bookshop\\'s plot turns on all the locals who mobilize to thwart Florence Green, and a stalwart few who come to her defense. If that sounds to you like a distended episode of the cozy British series Doc Martin, think again. Fitzgerald cultivated a particularly British appreciation for the futility of most human endeavor and a sharp eye for the destructive abuse of power and status. Based on her own experience working in Suffolk bookshop, her characters may seem like textbook amiable eccentrics. But they carry a dangerous edge when either gifted with too much power or cursed with too little, and she could distill a person\\'s essence with devastating economy. Here\\'s a characteristically sly little stealth-bomb that tells us all we need to know about a minor-but-significant meddler in the novel, who lands Florence in a heap of trouble. \"His fluid personality tested and stole into the weak places of others until it found it could settle down to its own advantage.\" That sentence doesn\\'t make it into Spanish writer-director Isabel Coixet\\'s adaptation (one feels for her — culling from Fitzgerald\\'s unfailingly crisp takedowns must have proven a challenge), but that meddler does. Played with delicious smirk and swagger by James Lance, Milo North is an empty vessel, a sometime television personality and interferer-for-hire with nothing better to do than take orders from the village\\'s moneyed dame, Violet Gamart (Patricia Clarkson, grandly waving bejewelled wrists to indicate refinement and taste), a reptile in dowager\\'s clothing who means to open a vaguely defined \"arts center\" in the dank old hulk of a house that Florence already occupies as she stocks up for her grand opening. Undaunted, Florence — played by Emily Mortimer in buttoned up florals, braids wound around the head, and a kindly, tentative smile — forges ahead, growing ever bolder in her literary tastes and doing rather well until a window display of Nabokov\\'s Lolita gives her enemies the opening they\\'ve been angling for. Coixet has a lyrical sense of place, and she has made a charming, well-acted adaptation that ably conjures visual pleasure out of the written word and evokes Fitzgerald\\'s love of art and her prescient elegy for the brick-and-mortar literary bookstore. But the movie is seriously weakened by its commercial anxieties, notably Coixet\\'s unwillingness to trust the audience to take on Fitzgerald\\'s more hard-headed insights into less savory quarters of the human psyche. Where Fitzgerald\\'s Suffolk is up to its ears in salt, damp and riddled with mold, Coixet\\'s landscape comes larded with scenic ocean vistas and waving grasses. She turns a manifestly literary comradeship into an unlikely love story between Florence and Mr. Brundish (Bill Nighy, a deadpan delight as always), a wealthy recluse with a killer reading habit and a soft spot for the intrepid bookseller who introduces him to Ray Bradbury. The pale but savvy, working-class little girl (a very good Honor Kneafsey) who comes to help out Florence in the store is made over with a posh accent and a fetching mass of Annie-style curls. Worse, Coixet has further tinkered with the plot to wedge in some fairly preposterous revenge plotting and a marketable voiceover from a famous British movie star matched to the age demographic. Such adjustments add up to a softening of Fitzgerald\\'s spirit of astringent inquiry, nudging it into Masterpiece Theatre territory that would have made the tough-minded author wince. For Fitzgerald and many of her generation of Brits, dogged perseverance was its own reward, a cardinal virtue no matter what the outcome of the struggle. Florence Green embodies Fitzgerald\\'s respect for courage under adversity. But The Bookshop is unequivocally a book about failure under the pressure of power, status, and influence. Force-feeding vengeance and victory into a parable that calls for neither, Coixet tailors a quintessential English story into a palatable tale for the American market', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4488}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/08/23/640970874/the-bookshop-a-caustic-tale-of-clashing-sensibilities-gets-a-too-gentle-treatmen', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-08-23', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 719, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'Coixet has a lyrical sense of place, and she has made a charming, well-acted adaptation that ably conjures visual pleasure out of the written word...'}}\n",

FilmRise hide caption When Cameron Post, a Montana teenager with bee-stung lips and an air of quiet intransigence, is caught smoking weed and making out with a girlfriend on prom night, her evangelical guardians pack her off to God\\'s Promise, a gay conversion therapy center whose inmates — no other word for it — are required to make and regularly revise drawings of the sinful roots of their sexual identities. At God\\'s Promise the word homosexuality makes the authorities jumpy, and even the gingerly label \"same-sex attraction\" signals the downhill road to moral rot. Needless to say Cameron\\'s cleansing doesn\\'t go well. Yes, there will be mutiny. But The Miseducation of Cameron Post is not a cookie-cutter saga of one youngster\\'s search for identity. Cameron, played low-key by Chloë Grace Moretz, pretty much knows who she is going in. In one of the movie\\'s many flashbacks, she and her lover (Quinn Shephard) watch Desert Hearts together, and the only question is whether Cameron will succumb to the brainwashing headed her way, in the name of a deity rigidly conceived as a paragon of absolutist rectitude. Religion can be a soft target for young filmmakers, and in subject and sensibility The Miseducation of Cameron Post has Sundance movie written all over it. (It won the grand jury dramatic prize at this year\\'s festival.) But there\\'s freshness in a film that is neither a hatchet job on Christianity, nor on belief per se. It is also not, let\\'s be clear, a search for spurious \"balance\" either. Directed by Desiree Akhavan (Inappropriate Behavior) and adapted by Akhavan with Cecilia Frugiuele from a YA novel by Emily M. Danforth, The Miseducation of Cameron Post is a sharply observed study — with a knife edge of satire, for sure — of the daily practice of soft tyranny by people not gifted with healthy self-doubt. There\\'s no physical abuse at God\\'s Promise, where kids are fed, watered, and kept in shape (and under control) with \"Blessercise\" videos and the occasional Christian rock dance party. Everyone in charge means well, from the loving aunt Ruth (Kerry Butler) who sent Cameron to the center, to the kindly, dithering counselor Reverend Rick (John Gallagher Jr.) who\\'s been dragged into \"recovery\" by his crusading sister Lydia, who runs the place with stubborn resolve packaged in a velvet glove. In a nicely controlled performance with an undertow of ferocity by the sweet-faced actress Jennifer Ehle (of television\\'s Pride and Prejudice), Lydia is the movie\\'s nearest thing to a monster. She\\'s a true believer on a mission, not a cynic, and as the action moves toward tragedy for a young resident with no psychic backup of his own, she shows us that there\\'s nothing more dangerous than a sincere fanatic. Luckily, Lydia doesn\\'t get that when you tell a bunch of teens that \"What feels like fun is actually the enemy,\" it will function as red cape to a roomful of bulls. For a film about teenagers gearing up for rebellion, though, the tone in the middle sections is a bit of a flat plane. Ordinarily a poised and vivid onscreen presence, Moretz tamps down her exuberant carnality into unrelieved woe. The pacing perks up when she bonds with two outsider comrades played by The Revenant\\'s Forrest Goodluck as a young Native American with his own definition of gay, and American Honey\\'s Sasha Lane as a feisty rebel who deploys her prosthetic leg to novel advantage. It comes as a relief when, on potato-peeling duty, Cameron leaps on the table and bursts into song with her new besties, a sign of liberating energies to come. It\\'s worth noting that later this year, Lucas Hedges will star in another gay conversion therapy drama, Boy Erased, directed by actor Joel Edgerton. As recently as a couple of years ago both films might have felt like behind-the-curve dramas celebrating battles already fought and won.

PBS hide caption Which is worse, corruption you can see or corruption you can't? In Dark Money, a documentary about invisible corporate shenanigans in her home state of Montana, director Kimberly Reed makes the incisive case that the latter threatens to sink our democracy outright. If 98 movie minutes about the subversion of campaign financing isn't quite your idea of beating the summer heat, let me start by saying there's not a dull or dry moment in Reed's briskly paced film about the secret assault on the American electoral and judicial process by corporations whose agenda is nothing less than the dismantling of government itself. Dark Money tells a hair-raisingly specific American tale of illicit power. In other words, the stuff of thrillers since Hollywood time began — except that in this muckraking expose, the graft was real. Mercifully, so was the pushback from a citizenry long-accustomed to corporate chicanery and led by a few savvy activists working very hard for free. Dark Money opens and closes with a flock of geese flying over a toxic copper quarry. As Reed's story unfolds, we learn that the beautiful birds' mass demise is only a tiny fraction of the wreckage caused by shady money moguls tinkering with electoral campaigns over a hundred years of Montana history. In part because its elected officials are ordinary folks who often double-up as farmers, teachers and the like, Montana is also heavy on a defiant populism that cuts across party lines. Which may be why it's also the only state, according to Reed, to have fought back locally against the U.S. Supreme Court's 2010 rollback of laws preventing corporations and unions using their treasury funds for electioneering. Skillfully fielding an enormous cast of witnesses and participants, Reed shows how Democrats and Republicans running for political and judicial office found themselves targeted by vicious attack ads from deep-pocketed non-profits with blandly vanilla names like Citizens United or Americans For Prosperity, or strategically crowd-pleasing monikers like Mothers Against Child Predators. No one had ever heard of these shape-shifting advocacy groups, and it was difficult to track the money back to the shadowy ideologues hiding behind them. With the ranks of the working press hamstrung by financial crisis, it fell to a shockingly small band of enterprising freelancers — helped by some highly compromising documents that turned up in a colorfully unlikely location — to uncover a trail of money and influence that led back to wealthy right-wing libertarians. (The Koch brothers come up a lot.) The rest is a gripping tale of self-help sleuthing topped off by the televised trial of Art Wittich, a local State Senator accused of being on the take. John Adams, a newly laid-off local reporter who will surely be played by Woody Harrelson in the event of a narrative remake of Dark Money, founded his own dirt-digging website with help from colleagues and donations from an increasingly outraged public. Attorney Gene Jarussi came out of retirement to work pro bono on tracing the money trail connecting Republican State Senator Wittich to an anti-environmental outfit murkily titled American Tradition Partnership. But perhaps the real heroine is Sarah Arnold, a young Republican former staffer for ATP who, disgusted by her employer's dirty tricks, agreed to testify at Wittich's trial. Here's hoping she has stayed safe since. Without the indispensable Dark Money, few of us would have heard of this David-and-Goliath struggle. Reed keeps the story mostly local while adroitly teasing out the broader threat of a lack of transparency that's been kicking around American politics since way before Watergate. Her riveting film shows how, with the Internet's global reach and the ever-growing concentration of money and power, dark money is redrawing the political landscape in ways that render parties irrelevant and imperil democracy itself. As one of the film's talking heads points out, when the Supreme Court of the United States decrees that corporations have the same rights as individuals, and financial contributions count as free speech, it is time to take the fight for democracy local, as Montana did. The trick will be to keep it up — and Dark Money shows what a long, hard grind that will be.\", 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4446}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/07/12/626693116/riveting-documentary-sheds-light-on-dark-money-in-montana-politics', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-07-12', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 716, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"There's not a dull or dry moment in Reed's briskly paced film about the secret assault on the American electoral and judicial process by corporations whose agenda is nothing less than the dismantling of government itself.\"}}\n",

Roadside Attractions hide caption What is left to say about the spectacular rise and agonizing fall of Whitney Houston, whose drug-fueled decline played out in such full public view that it\\'s hard to imagine any biopic rising above tabloid cliché? Give or take a few new tidbits about the pop superstar\\'s childhood scars and fluid sexuality, Scottish director Kevin Macdonald\\'s absorbing documentary Whitney doesn\\'t break with the sad blueprint that frames rock docs by the handful. How could it? Whitney\\'s path to ruin plays out like so many others\\', but it tacks eerily close to the one traced in Asif Kapadia\\'s 2015 Amy. Like her British counterpart, Amy Winehouse, Whitney Houston was a charismatic, terrifyingly fragile soul who came from a close but troubled family. In adulthood, she chose the wrong man to cling to like a limpet when her career eclipsed his and he took it badly. (Yes, Bobby Brown shows up on camera to insist that drugs had nothing to do with his former wife\\'s life or her death.) She struggled with, but mostly denied and indulged her drug habit until it was too late. Like Winehouse, too, she succumbed just when, having hit rock bottom, it seemed she had finally gotten her life back together. Macdonald\\'s film, however, does go deeper and more nuanced on things we mostly already know. A seasoned craftsman who tackled the checkered life of Bob Marley with his 2012 Marley and won an Oscar in for his 1999 doc One Day in September, Macdonald has dramatic flair to burn and a flashy way with montage that keeps faith with Houston\\'s enormous public persona. But Whitney is primarily a domestic drama enriched by the director\\'s more or less open access to the late singer\\'s estate. (The estate executor, Patricia Houston, is also executive producer of Whitney.) Without slighting the love and support Houston got from her cousin Dionne Warwick, from family friends and her devoted, psychologically astute assistant Mary Jones, Macdonald zeroes in on the lethal brew of parental ambition and emotional neglect that destabilized Whitney and the brothers who squired her around her tours — while keeping her stocked up with cocaine and worse. Their father, who was largely absent from Houston\\'s early life and leeched off her later wealth, had a lot to answer for. He\\'s no longer around to defend himself. But Whitney\\'s mother, Emily \"Cissy\" Houston, is, though her body language screams her discomfort. Squeezed into a pew in a church near where the family lived, the guarded, taciturn Cissy looks as though she\\'d rather be anywhere but here. To Macdonald\\'s quizzing about her daughter\\'s early years she responds in clipped monosyllables. No wonder: Cissy, a singer herself who never achieved the fame and fortune her daughter won, took her share of blame as the stage mother whose hard-driving ambition helped shape Houston\\'s frail psyche. And her success. Between the lines the movie also makes clear that Whitney, a shy, often bullied child, would never have become the superstar she did without her pushy parent. And for all the domestic sturm und drang, it\\'s the blossoming of Houston\\'s musical sensibilities that most engages in the film. Record producer Clive Davis and others who shaped her career guide us through the influences, black and white, that made Houston at once an innovator who fused gospel and soul with mainstream pop (the Rev. Al Sharpton pronounced her a traitor to black culture and called for a boycott) and a unifier whose feline beauty and fiercely radiant stage presence brought together audiences across class, race, and gender lines. Which is why the highlights of Whitney come not in the rehash of family friction but in Macdonald\\'s placement of well-known performance footage that shows off Houston\\'s power to connect. Of course, there\\'s her rendition of the national anthem at sporting events, a joyously bridge-building interpretation that echoed so much further than the stands. But she made magic out of her signature song, \"I Will Always Love You,\" first sung in the pretty terrible, incredibly popular 1992 movie The Bodyguard, in which Houston essentially played herself opposite Kevin Costner. Like that movie, the song is loaded to the gills with schmaltz. But context is all: Houston sang it again with thrilling resonance to ecstatic, multi-ethnic crowds of South Africans right after the fall of apartheid. Regal in a shimmering gown and golden turban, Houston brought such grace, passion, and dignified sense of occasion to a song that, left to its own devices, is a big ball of cheese, that she transformed it into an anthem of reconciliation for a nation newly sprung from vicious racial segregation. That — and not the coke-addled ruin Houston later became or her pitiful 2012 death at 48 in a Beverly Hills hotel bathtub — is all we need to remember her by.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4971}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/07/05/625750756/whitney-a-diva-deconstructed', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-07-05', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 826, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"For all the domestic sturm und drang, it's the blossoming of Houston's musical sensibilities that most engages in the film.\"}}\n",

Stories. NEON hide caption Now in his grizzled late fifties, Bobby Shafran is an affable, ordinary fellow whose life ran away from him back in 1980, when the nineteen-year-old freshman drove his beat-up Volvo to enter community college in upstate New York. He was puzzled at being effusively greeted by fellow students who called him Eddy. It quickly transpired that he was a dead ringer for another student at the college named Eddy Galland, who turned out to be the twin Bobby never knew he had. The discovery got into the local press, and soon a third lookalike, David Kellman, turned up. The identical triplets, all adopted by different families, were joyfully reunited and only too happy to take on the fairy-tale collective identity bestowed on them by the television talk shows. Which is when things began to really get weird, and not only because neither the boys nor their adoptive parents had known that other siblings existed. If Three Identical Strangers — an extraordinary documentary about the three brothers by British director Tim Wardle — were only about the deathless allure of identical offspring, it would still be a riveting tale. The demonstrable sameness of siblings hatched from the same egg excites the friction between our insistence on individual uniqueness and our desire for a mirror-image Other who will understand and defend us and keep us company forever. Or so the fantasy goes. It didn\\'t hurt that the three boys, as we see in home movies and clips from the television talk circuit, were telegenic teddy bears with liquid brown eyes, masses of black curls and bashful, camera-ready grins. Paraded before an enthralled public, they dutifully showed up in the same outfits, crossed their legs in unison on demand, confessed under pressure to having the same taste in women. All had wrestled in high school, and wasn\\'t it amazing that they all had adopted sisters? Bobby, Eddy, and David made the nightclub rounds, got married, opened a restaurant together. Their celebrity status was predicated on their sameness, and for so long as they could play along with the packaging, it was all so super-cute. Until it wasn\\'t, and here the boys\\' story, or stories (the plural bursts with significance), went from amazing to incredible to very, very dark. On its face, Three Identical Strangers presents as a straight-ahead documentary with the usual mix of home and media footage, re-enactments, and testimony from friends, family, other interested parties as well as two of the siblings themselves. In fact, the film is an artfully constructed investigative narrative structured to give us the sense of discovering, along with the boys and their families, several layers of buried secrets and lies that blighted their adult lives. If ever a story called for multiple narratives and deep digging into the past it\\'s this one. The triplets kept shedding identities and starting over in cataclysmic renewal — once at birth, again when they met and got swept into a media circus, and then, as new information peeled back their histories apart and together, in a reckoning that undid one of them and did serious damage to the others. From the moment they were born, the film shows, the adoptive families fell victim to casual abuses of power, from the adoption agency that concealed their biological parentage and their triplet status, to the scientists who used them as guinea pigs for a study of nature versus nurture that was never published, to the media that trapped them inside a fairy tale they could never live up to. Watching these families get gobbled up by skewed exposure to the public eye, I was reminded of Andrew Jarecki\\'s equally riveting 2003 doc Capturing the Friedmans, in which an already troubled Long island family caught up in a child abuse case was further crucified by rushes to judgment on the part of the police, the courts, the media and their local community. Wardle captures the families\\' outrage at what had been kept from them. Sensitive to historical context too, he brings in journalist Lawrence Wright, who wrote a book about twin studies, as well as former researchers on the study, to show that ethical concerns about privacy and disclosure were less encoded into professional practice in the sixties than they are today. Still, interpreting the past through re-enactment can be tricky. The adoption agency is closed now and there\\'s no one to verify the dramatized memory of one adoptive father who recalls stumbling on board members toasting one another with champagne after a meeting in which they thought they\\'d pacified angry parents with half-truths. In yet another twist to a serpentine tale that Wardle tracks like a thriller, we learn that the triplets had one more thing in common: All had troubled passages from childhood through adolescence, but its manifestations varied from boy to boy. All three grew up in Jewish families, but they spanned the class spectrum and their parenting styles varied, with one disciplinarian father taking the weight of blame for his son\\'s emotional instability. When a former researcher reads from the notes he took during the testing, we learn as much about the heedless parent-blaming that prevailed among psychologists after World War II as about the boys\\' early difficulties. Once the movie gets deep into the muck of how vulnerable the triplets were to forces beyond their control, the differences between them become stark, and even the similarities don\\'t tally up to the fable of happy similarity in which the media had wrapped them. Here the nature-nurture debate heats up and the movie\\'s pendulum swings from heredity to environment as we witness the disparate fates that befell the three men. \"It\\'s all about nurture!\" exclaims one relative. Not all, this nuanced film makes clear. And in one triplet\\'s baffled, anguished cry about a lost brother, \"Why him and not me? I don\\'t know,\" a clue emerges that there is nature, and there is nurture, and beyond both lie the unknowable mysteries of human character: Who succumbs to trauma and who survives, and what survival even means when you\\'ve lost your flesh and blood many times over. Toward the end of Three Identical Strangers Wardle brings two brothers together to inspect new information about their past on a laptop. What they discover is disturbing enough, but what really breaks the viewer\\'s heart is the nervous unease with which they greet each other, two identical strangers who were once close but seem not to have met in a while, and who seem to have lost the one thing that we assume twins should be able to count on.

Strand Releasing hide caption In July 2009 Gabriel Buchmann, a Brazilian student researching poverty in Africa, disappeared while on the last leg of a year-long backpacking trip through the continent. Gabriel and the Mountain, a docudrama made by his friend Fellipe Barbosa, lets us know right off the bat that Gabriel\\'s body was found by local villagers in Malawi nineteen days after he\\'d vanished. The film stresses that there was no sign that he had been attacked. His possessions remained intact, among them a photo collection that — along with Gabriel\\'s letters home, testimony from locals he befriended and from Cristina Reis, the girlfriend who traveled with Gabriela part of the way through Tanzania and Zambia — allowed Barbosa to retrace much of his journey with a 13-person film crew. The crew went up and down Mount Kilimanjaro with Barbosa, a hint that he and his friend bonded in shared obsessive tendencies. If the film were only a road trip garnished with lions and giraffes and hacked into country-by-country, a documentary might have sufficed. The mystery here, though, is less how Gabriel died than what led him to take so few measures to avoid dying of exposure — if avoidance was ever on the agenda. Gabriel and the Mountain is Barbosa\\'s fond, yet clear-eyed inquiry into how his childhood buddy\\'s mercurial temperament fed into his fate. Using professional actors to play Gabriel and Cristina and an array of non-pro African villagers to remember and re-enact their versions of the story, Barbosa tracks the feverish ups and downs of his friend\\'s journey through his charming, maddening character. As played by João Pedro Zappa and scripted by Barbosa with Lucas Paraizo and Kirill Mikhanovsky, Gabriel emerges as something of a mirror image to the wanderer played by Emile Hirsch in Sean Penn\\'s 2007 Into the Wild. An idealist dedicated to \"non-touristic, sustainable travel,\" Gabriel is an open-faced innocent who careens between ecstasy and despair, who can delight those he befriended (they are legion) one minute and drive them nuts the next. His idea of going native, to the amusement of Cristina (Caroline Abras) and the locals, involves carrying a staff and wrapping himself in brightly colored fabric. When his new friends talk him into killing and roasting a rabbit, he\\'s astonished when they tell him he\\'s the only meat-eater around the fire. If the first half of Gabriel and the Mountain sets up Gabriel\\'s often confused attempts not to come off as a Mzunga (white outsider), the second digs deeper into Gabriel\\'s erratic temper via his relationship with Cristina (Caroline Abras), who in real life consulted on the film. They make an appealingly lusty, passionately idealistic, occasionally absurd pair who share an expansive taste for trying on the new. But where Cristina understands the difference between calculated and foolhardy risk, Gabriel operates without filter or boundaries. As they begin to quarrel, they mark out the difference between adventure and the kind of careless folly that endangers others as well as the self. Toward the end of the film, a guide warns the young traveler that he doesn\\'t have time to get up and down his last mountain safely. Vowing to continue alone, Gabriel presses his hiking boots on the reluctant man, insisting that he will be fine in sandals. A woman climber at the foot of Mount Mulanje warns him again. Nothing doing: We see him whoop and gambol his way up the craggy slopes like a baby goat set free of the flock — then begin to whimper as his footwear fails him and he loses his bearings in a gathering storm. Does Gabriel and the Mountain add up to any more than a parable of reckless youth? Barbosa remains appropriately opaque about cause and motive. He nods briefly at Gabriel\\'s ongoing grief over the death of his father four years earlier. Perhaps, too, he was flirting with suicide. Certainly we see enough of his instability to make it a fair bet that, had he lived, Gabriel would have continued to struggle with emotional volatility. This is not a hero\\'s journey, though, and wisely, Barbosa doesn\\'t romanticize Gabriel or his efforts to become one with the object of his studies. The director\\'s here to honor his friend, and in keeping his head close to the ground of Gabriel\\'s final journey, he slips in a broader view of the strange tangles that can clog the encounter between passionate ideals and hard reality.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4533}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/06/14/619515077/gabriel-and-the-mountain-explores-how-a-young-man-died-and-how-he-lived', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-06-14', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 758, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"Barbosa tracks the feverish ups and downs of his friend's journey through his charming, maddening character.\"}}\n",

Lynn Johnson/Focus Features hide caption I expect you\\'ll be wanting to know whether Mr. Rogers was really like that in life. According to Won\\'t You Be My Neighbor? Morgan Neville\\'s loving portrait of the much-beloved champion of slow television for children, the answer is yes, but it\\'s complicated. Which is just what you want from a tender tribute that\\'s anything but a hagiography of the ordained Presbyterian minister who took the pie-in-the-face out of TV-for-tots. Fred Rogers was blown away by television\\'s potential — but he was disgusted by its corrupt pandering to advertisers and its exploitation of what he considered the worst in human nature — violence, contempt, condescension. So he sloooowed his TV neighborhood all the way down so he could really talk to kids about their lives and, more important, listen to what they had to say. His uniform on and off the set was comfy cardigans and sneakers. His audience was the under-ten demographic with parents in tow. He loved silence; \"modulation\" was one of his favorite words. Given the noisy, cranky, do-keep-up! times we live in now, that makes Rogers a tough subject for a documentary. Neville, whose most recent doc, Best of Enemies, took on verbal prize fighters Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley, and who made the terrific 20 Feet From Stardom about backup singers, is a master of many moods. He has this quiet one down too. Through Rogers\\' friend, the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, Neville secured access to the Fred Rogers Company\\'s enormous archive. Through clips from Mr. Rogers\\' Neighborhood, interviews with friends, family and crew, and footage from his public appearances, you will learn that Rogers was an astute philosopher who pioneered a safe, gentle space for kids in his Pittsburgh studio, but who never shied away from confronting the big issues — war, divorce, death — with puppets who spoke for their fears, anxieties and aggression. In many respects Fred Rogers was the gentle soul he projected on his show. He was many other things to boot, among them an instinctive diplomat. The film brings back the famous footage of Rogers charming the U.S. Senate, in six priceless minutes, into coughing up $20 million for PBS in 1969. Won\\'t You Be My Neighbor? offers the antidote to those who dismissed Rogers as too soft and anachronistic for his time back in the 1970s and 1980s. I felt that way myself when I first watched reruns with my daughter when she was small. But you could feel the air settle around you as Rogers walked on set, folded his stork-like frame into a small chair, and beamed his rapt attention at a child with a question or an observation. What shaped Fred Rogers? In Neville\\'s film you\\'ll see none of the pat \"background\" segment that so many docu-portraits serve up to \"explain\" how their subjects turned out the way they did. We are all so mysteriously more than our upbringings, and Neville leaves the explaining to those who knew this man best to reveal, gradually and in organic context, that as a child he was not allowed to express anger, and that in his teens he was bullied as \"Fat Freddie.\" These common-enough travails don\\'t always produce an adult as empathic as Rogers. His faith may have played a part: These days we rarely see the kind of Christian he was portrayed in media — open-minded, inclusive, full of the joys of everyday living (he was a spontaneous kibbitzer on set), yet intensely aware of the fact that becoming a good person was hard work every single day. Nor does Neville render Rogers as a saint. He could be thin-skinned about the inevitable late-night TV parodies of his folksy style. An attempt to create a show for adults failed. He built anti-racism into his children\\'s show but told a black, gay actor that he could not come out of the closet publicly because it would cost the show its sponsorship. (Rogers came around later to be an advocate for gay rights.) And his two sons lay out in ruefully affectionate detail the challenges of growing up with \"the second Christ\" as Dad. Watching Neville\\'s remarkable account of Rogers\\' life and work, you can\\'t help but wonder what this most conciliatory of spirits would make of our climate of chattering hostility today. He would surely have been appalled by the anti-gay zealots who demonstrated outside his funeral. What would he think of SpongeBob SquarePants (thumbs up, I suspect) or much of the fast-paced, aggressive children\\'s programming on offer today (thumbs emphatically down)? For that matter, if Mr. Rogers was a cry in the wilderness four and five decades ago, how would he go over now? One evening several years after my daughter was done with his show for good, I was enjoying a blessed moment of quiet as she and six of her eight-year-old friends over for a slumber party fussed around in their sleeping bags. Then came a rousing chorus of \"I love you/You love me/Let\\'s get together and kill Barney,\" followed by peals of rebel-girl laughter. I\\'m pretty sure Rogers would have ambled in, stroked his chin, wondered aloud if maybe Barney was people too, then gently called lights out. I\\'d be his neighbor in a heartbeat.

The film tells the story of the artist\\'s romance with Camille Claudel. Wild Bunch hide caption Deep into Rodin, Jacques Doillon\\'s quietly satisfying portrait of the famed French sculptor, a group of stuffy sponsors circles Auguste Rodin\\'s almost completed statue of France\\'s beloved novelist Honore de Balzac. Rodin (Vincent Lindon) has given the writer an enormous gut (he used a pregnant young woman and a draft horse rider as models for the belly), which the artist made capacious enough to house, in his imagination, the teeming characters who peopled the 19th-century writer\\'s stories. And, perhaps, his appetites. The work bristles with vital physicality, but it\\'s a long way from the heroic dignity and blaring metaphor the visitors were expecting. \"You\\'ve reduced Balzac to a shapeless mass,\" one complains, while another observes with malice, \"He\\'d need a neck too.\" The sculptor acidly inquires whether they\\'d prefer Balzac to be holding \"a quill and inkwells.\" No one present, Rodin included, grasps the fact that they\\'re witnessing a sea change in modern art. For all but the fine art mavens among us, Rodin was famous for The Thinker, the muscled dude cogitating with his chin in his fist. In Southern California, where I live, you can wave to the ponderer from the Pasadena freeway as he sits in the grounds of the Norton Simon museum. The poor fellow barely rates a mention in Rodin, except as part of the sculptor\\'s groundbreaking but unfinished work on his first state museum commission, Dante\\'s \"The Gates of Hell.\" We meet Rodin, smocked and extravagantly bearded, at age 40, feeling his way into new ways of working with his beloved clay, the most malleable of materials. The movie is less a biopic than an inquiry into the man, his art, and his loves, in no particular order and all tangled up in his seven-year struggle to bring the Balzac project to fruition. Rodin had a tempestuous ten-year affair with fellow sculptor Camille Claudel, his student, then his assistant and lover and finally his rival for recognition in France\\'s art world. Claudel, a tragic and therefore more movie-friendly figure who ended up arbitrarily committed by her family to an institution for 30 years until her death, has already been played by Isabelle Adjani in Bruno Nuytten\\'s Camille Claudel (1988) by Juliette Binoche in Bruno Dumont\\'s 2013 Camille Claudel 1915. Here we meet a very young Claudel, played with verve by the smart and sexy Izia Higelin, standing next to a hulking Rodin in his studio, contemplating the nude figures he\\'s intertwining for the Dante exhibit. \"I could be a modest presence by your side,\" she says slyly. Fat chance: The camera wheels and turns around these two enormous egos from opposite sides of the tracks, both of them passionately sexual and creative, both emotionally labile. Their love is a roller coaster ride, undercut in part by Rodin\\'s fitful loyalty to Rose Beuret (Severine Caneele), a servant whose son by him he refuses to acknowledge but whom he later marries. History remains murky on whether or not, as Claudel claimed, Rodin was complicit in the lack of recognition for her work. In Doillon\\'s reading, Claudel\\'s gender and the fact that her work was as frankly sexual as her former mentor\\'s certainly play a role. But Rodin\\'s failure lies more in his refusal to commit to her and in pressuring her to abort their unborn child than in blocking her career. Though he mourns the end of their love, he\\'s also freed by it, both sexually and in his work. Most movies about artists tiptoe reverentially around the art and focus instead on the tortured life. Rodin is very much about the work: Not since Jacques Rivette\\'s magnificent La Belle Noiseuse (1991) has a film zeroed in on creative process with the same obsessive care it devotes to the artist\\'s volatile love life. Less a narrative than a collection of evocative scenes, the film gives us Rodin as a monomaniac without boundaries and an un-self-consciously untutored innovator with form. We see him bond with other misunderstood artists like Claude Monet and Paul Cezanne. But though he\\'s his own kind of Impressionist, working in remembered snapshots of the human form, Rodin is far from hostile to realist representation. He insists on the dynamic primacy of the body as an expression of feeling and character. This is a man who caresses trees; who contorts his hapless models in suggestively weird postures for hours to capture the sexual dynamism of anatomy; who decapitates his own sculptures to test the full measure of the body\\'s expressive power; who refuses to surrender his vision of Balzac to the confines of a museum. Toward the end of Rodin, we see workers rolling out the statue in the artist\\'s backyard by the light of the moon. In a sweet contemporary coda, a gaggle of Japanese children heedlessly, happily play red-light-green-light around it, with only the wind and a soft cello to celebrate the man who set in motion \"the beginning of modern sculpture.\"', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 5095}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/05/31/615506588/rodin-shines-as-a-story-of-both-artist-and-art', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-05-31', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 854, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"Not since Jacques Rivette's magnificent La Belle Noiseuse (1991) has a film zeroed in on creative process with the same obsessive care it devotes to the artist's volatile love life.\"}}\n",

Nothing much, unless you count the fits and starts of a little girl\\'s inchoate grief over the death of her mother. That\\'s huge, and filmmaker Carla Simon is in delicately assured command of her material, not least because her mother was one of thousands of Spaniards who died of AIDS in the early 1990 — just before anti-retroviral medications became available — leaving Simon an orphan at six years old. But though the movie is set during the crisis it\\'s neither an AIDS movie nor a facile pity-party for Frida (Laia Artegas), a Barcelona urchin with wary eyes in a head full of wild black curls. Frida has never heard of AIDS — all she knows is that her mother is gone and she is dispatched to the Catalan countryside to live with her mother\\'s brother (David Verdaguer), his wife (Bruna Cusi) and her younger cousin Anna (Paula Robles), Frida doesn\\'t understand why a doctor periodically sticks needles into her arm. She\\'s not sure why everyone is tiptoeing around her and being so nice. She\\'s not aware of how she feels about sharing the limelight with another child, especially one as manifestly safe and happy as little Anna appears to be. She certainly doesn\\'t get why she needs a new mom, or why there\\'s no answer when she leaves night gifts for her own mother with a statue of the Virgin Mary. There will be other angles, but mostly this is a kid\\'s eye view of the collapse of her world as she knows it, an enormously difficult thing for a director to pull off when your two leads, who appear in almost every frame of the movie, are six and four years old respectively. When people talk about how great small children are in a film, what\\'s really meant is how well they\\'re cast, or how well they follow instructions, or how skilled the director is at getting them to be themselves in ways that meet the requirements of plot or character. All of the above pertain here: As Frida, Laia Artigas is a mini Anna Magnani with the tough, assessing watchfulness of a city street kid, while chubby, blue-eyed Paula Robles is all open innocence as country girl Anna, who\\'s as delighted to welcome a potential playmate as the guest is first bewildered and then inclined to pull senior rank. Frida doesn\\'t talk much in this intimately visual film, which takes the measure of her inner turmoil in the Catalan villagers\\' frightening (to her) ceremonies, in the terror of venturing out alone at night with nothing but ambient noise to guide her wanderings, in the cautious but happy discovery of where eggs really come from. Frida is quiet and co-operative to start with. Her uncle and aunt are lovingly attentive; her grandparents visit every week. But a small bomb ticks away inside Frida that neither she nor her hosts know what to do with, and soon she starts acting out in ways that range from annoying to dangerous. None of this is played to tug directly at our heartstrings. Like many children (and adults) in trouble they can\\'t grasp let alone escape, Frida becomes a pill. Simon never overplays her hand: Summer 1993 carries us from moment to unpredictable moment, placing us inside Frida\\'s confusion, her efforts to gain control of her feelings and her environment, and the fleeting bursts of happiness that come and go without warning. The result is a kind of grief procedural, its focus sharpened by the lush greens of the Catalan landscape. There\\'s an ending but no climax in Summer 1993. In place of closure, so rarely as elusive in art as it is in life, Simon unobtrusively opens up the perspective to the suppressed frustration and anger of those who, even as they welcome Frida with open arms, must grope their way through the radical reshaping of family that attends her sudden arrival.

Nicole Rivelli/Sony Pictures Classics hide caption Michael Mayer\\'s The Seagull, a fluid and faithful reading of the endlessly remounted stage play by Anton Chekhov, opens and closes with what looks like the same scene. The curtain has just gone down on a final act, and we hear clapping as the camera moves in to focus on leading lady Irina (Annette Bening, in superb command as always), flushed and beaming under the adulation she plainly can\\'t get enough of. Until, that is, someone whispers troubling news in Irina\\'s ear and rushes her away to — where else? — her lush country estate by a lake, where her sick brother Sorin (Brian Dennehy) has taken a turn for the worse. There\\'s something about art and life here, and by the end, when the scene repeats with implied but crucial differences, the overlap between the two will get a thorough workout. That\\'s if you\\'re paying attention: Like so much of Chekhov\\'s deceptively naturalistic work, The Seagull can be read (and probably was, and will be, in many a Comp. Lit. class) as just another bunch of unhappy Russians gassing on about how life has failed them. But how beautifully this top-drawer cast gases, in playwright Stephen Karam\\'s crafty adaptation of a play that Chekhov insisted was a comedy. Karam doffs his cap to the darkly funny backbone that Chekhov brought to bear on the well-worn theme of unrequited love. Like many women who depend on their looks for their livelihood and their self-esteem, the actress Irina has taken a much younger lover, successful playwright Boris Trigorin (Corey Stoll, aka Congressman Russo in House of Cards). She also cruelly undermines Konstantin, her as-yet-unknown playwright son (a goofily hapless Billy Howle), whose youth provides a constantly unwelcome reminder of her own aging. Locked in neurotic symbiosis with his mother, Konstantin also pines after Nina (Saoirse Ronan), a fair but fickle maiden on loan from another estate. Nursing grand ambitions of her own, Nina sets her sights at Trigorin, who is never one to turn down firm young flesh. Rounding out this lovelorn crew is a terrifically funny, achingly sad Elisabeth Moss as Masha, the snuff-snorting, liquor-swilling estate manager. She tags miserably along after an irritated Konstantin while swatting away her un-swattable suitor (Michael Zegen), a dull but dependable teacher. You get the picture, but though The Seagull has its moments of quietly knockabout farce, mostly the movie inclines intimately, subtly, to the sadness of the incomplete life. In director Mayer\\'s rhythmic pacing, the blemishes of one lost soul bleed into another\\'s suffering, which gets paid forward in an endless roundelay of thwarted desire and crushed dreams. Their hurts and sorrows seem common enough — love not returned, the complicated bond of mothers and sons, paths not taken, paths taken and regretted — and Mayer plays them out in a drifting ebb and flow set against a serenely bucolic landscape belied by the turmoil within each savage breast. On its opening night in Russia in 1896, The Seagull was all but booed off the stage by bewildered theatergoers schooled to expect upper-register melodrama. Devastated, Chekhov failed to show up for a fresh staging two years later, when audiences awakened to his poignant subtext rose in their seats to applaud the art of a writer then better-known for his short stories than his plays. Not for nothing is Konstantin a misunderstood experimenter with form. Naturalism is second nature to us these days, at least in indie chamber pieces like The Seagull. Yet Chekhov\\'s lack of moralism may baffle today\\'s moviegoers, or at least make them uneasy with the apparent lack of payoff in the plotting. No monsters lurk here, unless you count Trigorin, a heedless but likable cad who\\'s a prisoner of his compulsion to turn every astutely observed interaction into copy. But the rest of this uneasy ensemble is imprisoned as well, writhing in the grip of their obsessions and their longings for completion. There are no saints among them either, unless you count the observant, tolerant and obligatory doctor (Jon Tenney) who\\'s very good at reading the room but not much good at committing to those inside it. Irina is a terrible mother who really loves her son, while Masha can\\'t surrender her own fruitless passion for a young man way outside her league. If there\\'s a moral to the story it\\'s that we humans, however chastened by time and error, never learn from bitter experience. By the time the opening scene repeats, two years have passed, and what began as everyday misery threatens to deepen into tragedy. Far from sorting them out, The Seagull, true to its author, turns life into art that\\'s bold enough to ask, \"How shall we live?\" and brave enough to answer, \"With great difficulty.\"', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4917}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/05/10/609462480/dacha-ado-about-nothing-and-everything-the-seagull-soars', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-05-10', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 817, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'The Seagull, true to its author, turns life into art that\\'s bold enough to ask, \"How shall we live?\" and brave enough to answer, \"With great difficulty.\"'}}\n",

Kimberly French/Focus Features hide caption When it comes to undercutting her glam loveliness for the sake of a meaty role, Charlize Theron is the champ of champs. Meaty's the word: Having packed on the pounds and several tons of vicious attitude to play serial killer Aileen Wuornos in 2003's Monster and shed a (virtual) limb or two for 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road, Theron comes to us in Jason Reitman's Tully lugging a baby bump so massive, you can barely see her bringing up the fleshy rear. Lest we doubt her commitment to looking like most women do shortly after giving birth, there's a candid tracking shot from behind of her character — third-time mom Marlo — trying to outrun a lissome young athlete in the park. Like the rest of this maddeningly uneven movie, the scene is a little bit funny, a bigger bit cruel, and with it all, oddly moving. Luckily, with Theron it's never just about the prosthetics or the visual gags. For her Marlo, it's all in the eyes, bleary with fatigue and the stress that comes with being the mother of two small children (one of them with special needs, though Marlo's too exhausted to see anything but the special) and trying to cope with the third, who seems never to stop crying. On schedule, up pops the obligatory set piece where Marlo throws a fit in a school principal's office. Yet Theron plays even this scenario with the slow deliberation of a woman quietly nearing the end of her rope. Marlo's steady but preoccupied husband (Ron Livingston) isn't much help, and though at first she resists when her smug, well-heeled brother (Mark Duplass) presents her with a night nanny, she succumbs when the baby's arrival finally grinds her to a spaced-out standstill. Enter Tully (a very good Mackenzie Davis), a slightly manic yet unflappable pixie girl who also happens to be the fulfillment of every overwhelmed parent's compensatory dreams. Without turning a hair Tully cooks, cleans, gets baby to breastfeed, bakes fluorescent cupcakes for the kids' entire class. Over time she also becomes Marlo's confidante; the two become besties; the new mother blooms; the household grows a sly touch of eros. Until, suddenly, there comes a mischievous twist that steers this most realist of dramedies clear into fresh genre waters. And if, like me, you didn't see the denouement coming, you may say to yourself why, of course. Tully is written by Diablo Cody, who also wrote the screenplays for Reitman's smash hit Juno and for his bracing Young Adult, in which Theron starred as a pushing-forty narcissist belatedly trying to get her love-life on track. Cody and Reitman make a marketable team, smoothly packaging topicality in a skin of buoyant mischief that manages to straddle the glib and the true. At her most complacent, Cody can be a master of the breezy put-down, and here she gets off a few volleys of cheap shots at the expense of bougie-hipster parents — not like us, no, never — who worry about trace elements of caffeine in their decaf, and whose nannies have graduate degrees in early childhood development. Does it matter that Cody, who wrote Tully after hiring a night nanny to look after her third baby, and Theron, who has two adopted children of her own, can both afford all the help they need? In the sense that Marlo, who both wants and needs to get back to her job in human resources, is portrayed as a 99-percenter with 1-percenter problems, it's likely that for most moviegoers, Tully will end up as a wishful fantasy on more levels than one. What saves the movie from unbearable smugness is the lovely duet of Theron and Davis playing their deepening partnership without either posturing or a disclaiming wink at the audience. So much so that we can believe in Tully, a mere stripling with troubles of her own, serenely guiding a woman many years her senior through the black comedy and the sludge of early motherhood, through her dreams of regressive escape, and on into the grownup zone. If Juno was about the ramifications of getting pregnant way too young, Tully worries that middle age isn't much of a help when you're trying to juggle multiple tasks and roles within a raging-hormonal body you barely recognize. If Young Adult insisted that an overgrown child stuck in eternal arrested development doesn't deserve an upbeat ending, Tully serenely suggests that fulfillment is about the repetition of dreary routine made bearable by the love of others, and the love you bear for them. Tully may be rounding out a trilogy, but I suspect that Reitman and Cody are re-upping as we speak for What to Expect When You're Re-Feathering the Empty Nest.\", 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4721}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/05/03/607868574/in-tully-charlize-theron-and-mackenzie-davis-make-a-great-au-pair', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-05-03', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 811, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'What saves the movie from unbearable smugness is the lovely duet of Theron and Davis playing their deepening partnership without either posturing or a disclaiming wink at the audience.'}}\n",

Sundance Selects hide caption Let the Sunshine In is the poorly translated title (more on that later) of the new film by French director Claire Denis. It opens with a scene that has launched many a tale of female romantic travail. Isabelle, a Parisian painter played with characteristic heart and soul by Juliette Binoche, lies beneath her lover, waiting for him to achieve climax and to stop asking her, for heaven\\'s sake, if she\\'s there yet. With his own mission accomplished the lover, an oafish banker played to the nasty hilt by filmmaker Xavier Beauvois, wants to know if Isabelle has enjoyed more efficient orgasms with other men. She slaps his face and turns her back, then agrees to meet the oaf that weekend. Needless to say he doesn\\'t show, and that will prove true of several other unsatisfactory, mostly married men who, one way or another, can\\'t or won\\'t give Isabelle the enduring love she seeks, yet won\\'t let her be either. A self-absorbed actor (Nicolas Duvauchelle) insists he\\'s leaving his wife but, having allowed Isabelle to inveigle him into staying the night, wallows in morning-after regret. There\\'s pain aplenty here, but though the movie runs up and down the mood register from hilarity to saxophone-fueled sadness to despair and back up to hard-won irony, the tone is never mawkish or self-pitying. If anything Denis, who co-wrote the wittily cascading — and, from time to time, coruscating — dialogue with the novelist Christine Angot, has cooked up a fresh sub-genre: the looking-for-love comedy procedural. In another kind of movie Isabelle would bravely soldier on through cad after cad until Mr. Sensitively Woke makes his grand entrance and pouf! fin. Not here: Let the Sunshine In is the sum of its moments, of Isabelle\\'s inner and outer processing of her predicament with only hope to buoy her flagging spirits. What energizes the movie and makes it delightful is that the guys are not all jerks, and that Isabelle is no picnic herself. Her needy insecurity renders her vulnerable and all too easily unsettled by facile judgments from others, which among other fruitful inquiries treats us to a very funny exchange with the great Josiane Balasko, who plays Isabelle\\'s powerhouse gallerist. Teasing genre is not new for the bracingly innovative Denis, who has dabbled in horror (Trouble Every Day), though she\\'s famous for her political dramas (Beau Travail, White Material) set in Africa where she spent her childhood. Her next film, starring Robert Pattinson, will be set in space. For a film that\\'s clearly meant to be experimental and fragmentary — it was worked up between other projects from Angot and Denis\\'s own histories, with the late French cultural theorist Roland Barthes poking his head in from a great distance — Let the Sunshine In moves between dialogue and carnal interludes with rhythmic fluidity. The mostly nocturnal settings and sumptuous black and red palette intensify Binoche\\'s soulful sensuality. Her eyes are black orbs of infinite depth, and she wears so many leather jackets and thigh-high boots that the filmmakers might be hearing from PETA, but those clothes exert a magical, if temporary hold on the men who love and leave her. \"Take care of me a little bit,\" she beseeches a man who manifestly takes care of nobody but himself. What redeems Isabelle even as it gets her into hot water is her devastating candor with everyone, from the banker who envies her boho lifestyle yet constantly puts her down, to the stranger (Paul Blain) from the wrong side of the tracks who dances her into quiet ecstasy, to the cab driver about whose happiness she inquires at the end of a day that leaves her emotionally drained. She\\'s frank about herself too: Even her former husband (Laurent Grevill), with whom she has a child, gets roundly scolded when he makes a wrong move in bed. If Denis sometimes skates close to making a virtue of Isabelle\\'s honesty, it\\'s refreshing to hear such straight talk from a woman on screen. Still, something has moved in Isabelle. Enter Gerard Depardieu, speaking words of wisdom and beauty. It\\'s not what you think, but his lovely speech about her predicament clues both Isabelle and us into acceptance of life\\'s enduring ambiguities. And then, he reminds her, there\\'s her work. Has Isabelle learned at last to let the sunshine in?

Neon hide caption Early in the Swedish-made sports movie Borg vs. McEnroe, Bjorn Borg (Sverrir Gudnason) ducks into a Monaco bar to escape a pack of screaming girls after practicing for an especially tricky upcoming Wimbledon championship. The tennis star is without his wallet, so he helps out schlepping boxes in return for a free espresso and tries to convince the bartender that he's an electrician by trade. The barkeep doesn't buy it, and really, who would when confronted with those chiseled facial bones, maximally toned leg muscles, and blond curls improbably squashed under a baseball cap? Lest you imagine, though, that all you're about to see is the humble man of the people beneath the superstar, director Janus Metz and screenwriter Ronnie Sandahl have a different tale to tell about the legendary rivalry between Borg, a four-time Wimbledon winner, and John McEnroe, the brash American upstart with a killer backhand and truly awful manners. Which is not to say that the smoothly crafted, satisfyingly earnest Borg vs. McEnroe ventures far from the standard sports biopic template. There they are: the backstories full of heartache and deficit parenting; the intertitles insisting that sports are the ultimate metaphor for life; the separate narrative paths all inexorably leading to a Great Event — in this case the fabled 1980 Wimbledon game in which two stellar players bludgeoned one another into a seemingly endless run of match points before one came out on top. Nicely gussied-up with special effects and tennis-playing stand-ins intercut with actual footage, the finale is a riveting spectacle. The rest is biography, heavy on the flashbacks, of two radically different temperaments with more history in common than meets the eye. Shia LaBeouf surely didn't have to dig too deep within himself to come up with a terrific rendition of McEnroe, a curly-headed, ferocious competitor who is rude and aggressive on and off the court, prone to cheating even a close friend, a showy fighter with a killer left backhand. A player with more drive than finesse, McEnroe is equally unpopular with umpires and the crowd, and he pretends not to care that the crowd invariably roars for his graceful, focused opponent. The twist is that Gudnason's Borg comes off as his own species of psychological wreck. Shy, anxious and compulsive, he travels with umpteen tennis racquets whose precise tension he tests out by walking on them before every match. And though he is an elegant stylist on the court — a gentleman in a gentleman's sport despite, or more likely because of, his working-class background — Borg fails to attend to the mounting frustration of his patient, longtime girlfriend (Tuva Novotny). Both men, we learn, had troubled childhoods that scarred them with a load of rage and frustration and left them eternally incomplete, forever striving for elusive perfection. In the film one of them is rescued and steadied by a coach (Stellan Skarsgard) who has seen enough failure himself to understand that anger and pain must be channeled, not repressed, and that as in life, every game must be won point by point. Their undernourished childhoods have made unhappy winners of both men. One of them has to lose this round; in this big-hearted movie, life is more than the sum of its victories and defeats. The finale has us rooting for it to be true that, in the nail-biting final stretch of the game, Borg murmured a few words to his opponent that defrosted some hard, undernourished place in both their hearts — and allowed them to grow into men, menschen, and lifelong friends.\", 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 3755}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/04/12/600948276/borg-vs-mcenroe-game-set-and-an-unlikely-match', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-04-12', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 622, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'Smoothly crafted, satisfyingly earnest...'}}\n",

Amazon hide caption The Scottish director Lynne Ramsay has a rapturous way with a camera that has served her beautifully in a small but impressive resume of intense films that skew to the dark side of blighted psyches. In works like Gasman, her moody 1998 short about a little girl who discovers by chance that she has a sister, and Ratcatcher (also 1998), about life on Glasgow\\'s grimy underside, Ramsay has been the best of the handful of women working in noir terrain. Her affinity for bleak British lives in free fall has often gotten her lumped in with British miserabilists like Mike Leigh and Ken Loach. In fact, Ramsay is an ardent stylist for whom beauty, grime, and terror go hand in hand with generous helpings of black comedy. At her finest, Ramsay is a painterly lyricist of the tortured inner life, but her work took a turn for the merely sensational with We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011), adapted from Lionel Shriver\\'s novel about a school killer seen through the eyes of his mother. Her new film, You Were Never Really Here, is at once her boldest and, for my money, her least successful. Adapted from a novella by the American writer Jonathan Ames, the movie stars Joaquin Phoenix as Joe, an army veteran and former FBI agent specializing in sex-trafficking. Now living with his skeletal, demented and ambivalently adored mother (Judith Roberts), Joe is running to seed. Muscle is turning to fat, and his back and shoulders are pocked with scars, the mark of past traumas from childhood and the military that pop up at exhaustively regular intervals in shards of unexplained memory. With his tiny ponytail and ubiquitous hoodie, Joe cuts a portentously retro figure, as if recently liberated from a multi-pack of shrink-wrapped Hell\\'s Angel figurines. Joe regards his freelance gig as a rescuer of kidnapped girls less as a job than a calling, a kink of his damaged psyche that has prompted inevitable comparisons with Taxi Driver. When an ambitious Senator (Alex Manette) calls on him to recover his daughter Nina (Ekaterina Samsonov) and lay waste to her molesters, Joe goes about his mission with gusto and method. As in all Ramsay\\'s movies, there\\'s wicked humor here that breathes new meaning into the term Hammer Horror: Joe\\'s weapon of choice comes from the hardware store, not the gun shop, and when not dispatching those who would sully the purity of virgins, he takes a break to indulge in jovial sing-alongs with Mom while polishing the silver, or chills out by breathing into plastic bags. By way of plot, poor Joe\\'s so bent out of mental shape that he fails to see that he\\'s slaughtered his way into a trap. At least I think it\\'s a trap; it\\'s hard to be sure, so mired is the action in toxic-avenger brutality set to stolid repeat. Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood\\'s meaningfully strident score. Though always attuned to the plight of powerless women, Ramsay has always been a slyly subversive feminist. Who could forget the sublime moment in Morvern Callar (2002) when a publisher woos Samantha Morton, who has stolen her dead boy friend\\'s manuscript, by extolling the book\\'s \"distinctive female voice?\" Yet the women of You Were Never Really Here never come to life: Mom is a caricatured horror staple; Nina\\'s a stoned cipher, a mere extension of Joe\\'s savior complex. As for Joe, if any actor can signal nut-job and lost-soul in one performance, it\\'s Phoenix. He\\'s always terrific, yet You Were Never Really Here keeps us trembling in such constant dread of the brutality to come, it\\'s all but impossible to focus on Ramsay\\'s empathy for Joe\\'s broken state. Does he save himself by his struggles to save Nina? The frustratingly ambiguous ending mirrors and romanticizes, but fails to illuminate Joe\\'s tenuous grip on reality.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 3979}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/04/05/598810238/when-your-savior-complex-isnt-particularly-the-brutal-you-were-never-really-here', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-04-05', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 675, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"Style overwhelms substance; characters recede into a fog of endless setup accentuated with Johnny Greenwood's meaningfully strident score.\"}}\n",

Jean-Claude Lother/Magnolia Pictures hide caption Keep an open mind going into a film by Arnaud Desplechin, and if you can stand the abundance of enigma and apparent disorder you\\'re likely to come out with an opened mind and a filled heart. The French writer-director\\'s every movie is, and is about, a heroically doomed quest to make sense of the tragicomedy we call life — his own life, specifically. Here, he\\'s once again represented by actor Mathieu Amalric, wild-eyed and lost in untended chin-stubble. Desplechin treats plot and character as plastic experiments, a trying-on of hats in the name of inquiry into existence and identity. His movies come thick with cultural reference: Names come and go, attach themselves to different characters, reappear in a new film as themselves in different scenarios. But sometimes a person can be so open-minded that their brains fall out, and that is the case with Desplechin\\'s latest, Ismael\\'s Ghosts. Fans will recognize the name as the brother of Paul Dédalus, the tortured hero played by Amalric in three earlier Desplechin films, My Sex Life...Or How I Got Into an Argument (2004), A Christmas Tale (2008) and his terrifically rich prequel My Golden Days (2015). Only now Amalric is Ismael, a filmmaker who can\\'t sleep for not being able to finish making a spy thriller of sorts about Ivan Dédalus (Louis Garrel), a relation of sorts and a misbegotten diplomat who gets himself stuck in Tajikistan for reasons unclear. He has trouble sleeping too. Ivan potters off to the side of a narrative device that, in more conventional hands, might frame a nicely heated domestic melodrama. Though happily shacked up with Sylvia (Charlotte Gainsbourg), a supportive and seemingly unflappable astrophysicist, Ismael is derailed by the sudden return of his wife, Carlotta (Marion Cotillard), a minx of uncertain motive who vanished two decades earlier, devastating both her husband and her father, Henri Bloom (Laszlo Szabo). What is Bloom, who has sporadically lost his own plot, doing in these endlessly mushrooming ancillary stories other than as a premonition of old age? Ask me another. Always obsessed with reading the past, Desplechin keeps us busy with filler about how Ismael met and bonded with each of the two women. Hard though it is to imagine two more versatile actresses than Cotillard and Gainsbourg, Sylvia and Carlotta become distinct personalities only as they orbit around Ismael. For a scientist, Sylvia spends a lot of time lolling on the beach, propping up her lover\\'s ego or making up beds for unwanted guests. Is Carlotta a woman in pain or a serial home-wrecker? (Lest you doubt her ambiguous identity or her rating as wife material, Desplechin assigns her a weird little dance to Bob Dylan\\'s \"It Ain\\'t Me, Babe.\") And a friendly third woman with a double identity (Alba Rohrwacher) enters the picture mainly as a love interest for Ivan, whose difficulty attracting women seems to be the least of his problems. Who is Ismael anyway? His name suggests other ghosts: Might he be the Ishmael of Genesis, Isaac\\'s exiled brother wandering through the desert, and founding father of the Arab peoples? The interpreting narrator of Herman Melville\\'s Moby Dick? Or, for the literal-minded, just a modern-day wreck who can\\'t find a way to finish his movie? Multiple meanings are Desplechin\\'s bread and butter and the fertile terrain of his mostly wonderful films. Like Ismael, though, he seems to have lost the thread that will tie together his stories and generate something for us to chew over.

L to R: Dermot Crowley as Kaganovich; Paul Whitehouse as Mikoyan; Steve Buscemi as Krushchev; Jeffrey Tambor as Malenkov; Paul Chahidi as Bulganin. Nicola Dove/IFC Films hide caption Nobody shuts up for a nanosecond in The Death of Stalin, a wickedly gabby black comedy about the noxious power vacuum that followed the Soviet dictator's sudden collapse from a stroke in 1953. We've come to expect untamed banter from director Armando Iannucci, creator of In the Loop and Veep, who, with his frequent collaborators David Schneider, Ian Martin and Peter Fellows, adapted The Death of Stalin from two French graphic novels by Fabian Nury and Thierry Robin. There's no plot as such, only a posse of the dead ruler's lieutenants trading jibes, insults, and wasn't-he-great bromides in dialogue studded with the kind of tart, loopy one-liners that littered Veep and In the Loop. Here, too, the subject is the hunger for power and the crazed mechanics of political process in crisis, but the terrain shifts from our own creaky, leaky Western democracies to the last gasp — maybe — of one of the two most brutally efficient autocracies of the 20th century. The year is 1953 and Joseph Stalin — a coarse fellow who loves dirty jokes as much as he loves Mozart and is played in broad Cockney by Adrian McLoughlin — has arbitrarily dispatched millions of his own people over a period of twenty years. Twenty minutes in he's felled by a stroke after a possibly dissident concert pianist (Olga Kurylenko) slips him a scalding note in the sleeve of a recording of her recital. So effective has Stalin been at playing divide-and- rule with his own Politburo that the two days following quickly devolve into chaotic farce, with his minions panicking wildly as they vacillate over whether to keep his reign of terror oiled or seize the day to loosen things up a mite. A funeral is planned and executed. Mostly, though, they jockey for power and try to stay off the swelling roster of the condemned. Iannucci has put together a crackerjack ensemble from both sides of the Atlantic, all mercifully freed from assuming the fake foreign accents that make so many action movies set in Russia sound like Monty Python knockoffs, and all playing characters at once monsters and ordinary people. Jeffrey Tambor is wonderfully hapless as Malenkov, an image-conscious bumbler and Stalin's successor were it not for the sneaky wiles of one Nikita Krushchev (Steve Buscemi), a seemingly clumsy clown who shows up for a crisis in his jammies. Jason Isaacs has a ball as the crude general Zhukov, flush with medals and hell-bent on replacing Stalin's notorious NKVD enforcers with the equally brutish army. And Andrea Riseborough brings simmering hysteria to a minor role as Stalin's daughter Svetlana, a Nervous Nellie whose ingenuous belief in her father and in the system leaves her and her drunken lout of a brother, Vasily (Rupert Friend), open to manipulation by all comers. But the movie's star is the Shakespearian actor Simon Russell Beale as Beria, the sociopathic architect of Stalin's death machine. Expertly wheeling between total stitch and holy terror as he searches for new victims to add to his infamous list of candidates for imminent knockoff, Beria and his roster propel the movie's bitter running joke — the creation of a climate of insanity in which no one knows from one minute to the next what's real and what's fake news or, more frightening yet, no news. At a little under two hours, the movie's endless stream of clever one-liners can get exhausting. Half an hour into The Death of Stalin, I began to fantasize about locking Iannucci in a room with his American counterpart Aaron Sorkin and letting the two of them clout each other over the head with subordinate clauses until the best man wins or they both fall face-first onto their keyboards. Yet though The Death of Stalin is a one-joke movie about how plotting and pandemonium invariably pour into a leadership vacuum, it's a deadly serious joke that we'd do well to attend to. Iannucci has said that some of the movie's most farcical scenes were taken from real life, but he never overtly winks at current parallels East or West. He doesn't have to. We know the real-life outcome of this mad interregnum, in which Krushchev crept up quietly, snatched the reins from the bumbling Malenkov and tinkered with reforms while retaining central power. At the close, though, when Krushchev fails to notice a dour apparatchik, name of Brezhnev, quietly biding his time, The Death of Stalin reminds us that if Nature abhors a vacuum, so, too, does another despot-in-waiting.\", 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4661}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/03/08/590879975/iannuccis-the-death-of-stalin-amid-chaos-great-energy', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-03-08', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 788, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"Though The Death of Stalin is a one-joke movie about how plotting and pandemonium invariably pour into a leadership vacuum, it's a deadly serious joke that we'd do well to attend to.\"}}\n",

Great Point Media hide caption Among his other abundant talents, Stanley Tucci gives great smirk. His curling lip lends itself to a devious complacency that, for many years, stuffed the actor\\'s resume with bad-guy roles in all shades of movie noir. Until, that is, casting directors woke up to his wily gift for deploying a smug imperviousness as cover, while signaling inner turbulence that\\'s about to blow up. Who could forget that stomach-churning moment in The Devil Wears Prada when he, as the compulsively loyal lieutenant of Meryl Streep\\'s Miranda, finds out — at a party — that he will not be her successor? All of that makes Tucci a snug fit for Ted Swenson, a disgruntled writer-in-residence at a lower-tier liberal arts college in New England where he teaches creative writing to undergraduates with more motivation than talent. In the nimble new campus drama Submission, Ted\\'s voiceover fills us in on a tawdry tale of crash-and-burn that gives the lie to his habitual air of above-the-fray amusement. We meet Ted in reasonably good shape with one \"moderately successful\" novel under his belt and a marriage to the understanding Sherrie (Kyra Sedgwick) that has yet to run out of juice. Yet he\\'s stalled on his second novel and suffering from a vague discontent he doesn\\'t care to explore. When a waifish student named Angela (Addison Timlin) butters him up with comparisons to Stendhal and asks him to look at her manuscript about a high-school student who enters into a steamy tryst with her teacher, the blocked writer is set up for a swift fall anyone could see coming, even if they hadn\\'t read Francine Prose\\'s wicked 2000 campus novel Blue Angel, from which Submission is adapted by director Richard Levine. Oblivious to the red flags flapping in front of his nose, Ted is also blind and deaf to his own devices and desires. In this he\\'s far from alone. Throw sex into a blender with power and ambition and you get a whole raft of unreliable narrators, and that includes not just Ted and Angela, but the entire English Department of this peaceful New England campus. Holding a fine line between black comedy and low-level terror, Levine deftly skewers, via the supercilious Ted, the petty rivalries and pretensions of academic politics. And what is Tucci doing as Ted falls victim to a fetching predator who\\'s all flattery until she\\'s all business? Calmly spinning the yarn for us while his face subtly strives to contain the mounting panic within. An astute observer of the frailties of others, Ted is a clueless interpreter of his own, until it\\'s too late. The slyly titled Submission may have been a while in the making, but its release is ridiculously timely and likely to usefully ruffle feathers among those who see no shades of gray in the furor over sexual politics on and off campus. Ted may be a train awaiting wreckage, but Angela, played by Timlin with cunning ambiguity, is no saint. She\\'s a conniving minx who knows precisely how to play victim while extracting maximum advantage from the cultural moment. She has a better grasp of the Zeitgeist — and the literary market — than Ted does, and the fact that she can also write puts a bracing kink in the plot that forbids us to set up camp on one side or the other. There are winners and losers here, but while Levine gifts Ted with a more open future than Prose does in her novel, Submission ends up, quite properly, as a tale without heroes. It\\'s an age-old fable about the point where desire meets device, and invariably loses.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 3642}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/03/01/589595506/in-the-caustic-submission-stanley-tucci-is-small-man-on-campus', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-03-02', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 626, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"It's an age-old fable about the point where desire meets device, and invariably loses.\"}}\n",

Lionsgate hide caption Look closely at a frame from Early Man — or any of the other features and shorts by Nick Park, the stop-motion animator behind Creature Comforts, the Wallace and Gromit series, and Chicken Run — and you can spot the truest and most literal of all auteur stamps: The curvatures of a fingerprint. As computer animation has become the dominant format, Park and his craftspeople at Aardman Animations have remained defiantly analog, using their hands to manipulate the features of plasticine models, frame by painstaking frame. (The word \"painstaking\" must be used to any reference to his work, as fair acknowledgment of the numbing tedium involved.) Among its abundant delights, Early Man doubles as Park\\'s sly statement about his own process, which may seem exceedingly crude and outdated, but has the warmth and personality of a homemade, hand-crafted production. In fact, the lovable Stone Age half-wits who populate the film are surprised to learn that they really shouldn\\'t exist at all. Civilization has advanced to the Bronze Age, giving an evolutionary edge to those in possession of suits of armor, heavy coins, pots and pans, and other such shiny emblems of human advancement. Park and company stage a soccer match as a proxy battle between Team Aardman and Team Pixar (and Everybody Else), but true to form, there\\'s not a whiff of hostility in the fight. On screen and off, the crudes just want to keep their own place on the landscape. The fun begins in the Neo-Pleistocene Age (somewhere near Manchester, the title informs us), where a band of cavemen survive an asteroid crash and accidentally invent the game of soccer. In the international sporting scene, such a moment is the equivalent of the hominids discovering weapons in the prologue to 2001: A Space Odyssey, but the Stone Age tribe has all but forgotten how to play when the timeline catches up to them. Dug (voiced by Eddie Redmayne) and his mates are content to hunt rabbits around their forest home until they clang into their Bronze Age oppressors, led by the unctuous Lord Nooth (Tom Hiddleston), who swiftly banishes them from their land. The rest of Early Man is devoted to a classic underdog sports-movie scenario: If Dug and his tribe can beat the Real Bronzio superstars in soccer, a game they\\'ve never played, they will win back their freedom. With plucky defector Goona (Maisie Williams) as their coach — the kingdom doesn\\'t allow female players — they montage their way to competence on the pitch. The central joke is that soccer is such a simple game that cavemen could have invented it and the central sentiment is that good old-fashioned teamwork can overcome the challenge of flashier betters. The one knock on Aardman is that its full-length features, like Chicken Run and Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, cannot sustain the charm of its diamond-cut short features, in part because their cheery slightness fits the smaller format. Early Man comes closer to the others, thanks to the durability of the underdog-sports-movie conceit and the culture-clash yucks of the daft, clumsy Stone Agers continually smacking headlong into progress. Sometimes comedy, like soccer, is a simpler game than it\\'s made out to be. Then again, Park fills the screen with unexpected and whimsical creations, too, like a giant toothsome duck that terrorizes the land like a remnant from the Jurassic Age, an orange warthog of sorts named Hobnob that\\'s like a silent, capable Gromit to Dug\\'s hapless Wallace, and a talking bird (Rob Brydon) that sends mostly incendiary messages to Lord Nooth from the Queen. In the Park style, every living thing has prominent lips, crooked teeth, and generous midsections, looking every bit the humble townspeople living miles away from the Magic Kingdom. After a 12-year absence from feature filmmaking, Park and his team have done nothing to spruce themselves up for the digital age — and they wouldn\\'t (and shouldn\\'t) have it any other way.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4119}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/02/15/585839395/early-man-is-a-mammoth-delight', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-02-15', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 684, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"Among its abundant delights, Early Man doubles as Park's sly statement about his own process, which may seem exceedingly crude and outdated, but has the warmth and personality of a homemade, hand-crafted production.\"}}\n",

Roadside Attractions hide caption British filmmaker Sally Potter, a bold adventurer with form and genre, has racked up a formidable resume of hits and some misses, among them the gorgeous historical gender-bender Orlando (1992); the sexy dance movie The Tango Lesson (1996); The Man Who Cried (2001), a tone-deaf Holocaust misfire; and the terrific Ginger and Rosa (2012), which explored the tricky friction between ideology and private behavior on the lefty margins of 1960\\'s London, where Potter came of age. Potter\\'s latest, basically a filmed play confined to a trendy London town house and tastefully shot in black-and-white, mines similar territory to that of Ginger and Rosa, only with a more arid, less forgiving spirit. A contemporary farce with aspirations to satire and an awkward dab of tragedy, The Party clocks in at a mercifully trim 71-minutes, which is more than enough time to fire volleys of flat-footed cheap shots across the bows of a group of chattering-class friends who gather in a trendy London townhouse to celebrate the promotion of their hostess. Janet (a very good Kristin Scott Thomas) has just been named Shadow Minister for Health, a key opposition post under a Tory government bent on cutting an already strapped National Health Service to the bone. Public wellness, however, is the last thing on her mind as she fields phoned-in congrats with ostentatious false modesty while murmuring can\\'t-talk-now to a mystery lover on the other line. Between the lines Janet offers sporadic attention to her arriving inner circle, played by a distinguished ensemble with panache and waggery to burn, were there more wit in Potter\\'s script to set satire aflame. The party is pooped early on when Janet\\'s husband Bill (Timothy Spall), a morose academic of modest output, stages a couple of stealth announcements of his own, setting off a round robin of revealed secrets, lies, and long-suppressed rage that ricochet around the strategically claustrophobic space, bringing the group closer in ways they\\'d rather avoid. Janet\\'s best friend April (Patricia Clarkson) sprays periodic contempt on her partner Gottfried, a New Age life coach and equal-opportunity pacifier played, in a strange flourish of counter-casting, by Bruno Ganz, better known as Adolf Hitler in the 2004 German film Downfall. Rounding out this sorry crew are Martha (Cherry Jones) and her much younger lesbian lover, Jinny (Emily Mortimer), who is carrying the couple\\'s presumably engineered triplets, and Tom (Cillian Murphy), a banker who appears to have been dressed by Tom Ford but who otherwise strains to keep his cool, which has something to do with the fact that his wife, also a Friend of Janet, is conspicuous by her absence. Notwithstanding the acoustic version of Blake\\'s \"Jerusalem\" in the opening scenes, it\\'s hard to know what interests Potter here. The Party is set sometime in the post-Brexit present, but Potter brushes past the political to land on the gap between public face and private behavior that is the meat and potatoes of domestic satire. Just about everyone here is busily betraying a friend or partner with someone present. The hypocrisy puts us squarely in Bunuel territory, the domestic fury in Albee country. Potter\\'s strength has always lain more with elegant form than substance; with the exception of Ginger and Rosa, whose characters had the ring of authenticity drawn from her own experience, she\\'s less comfortable with realism. Stranded somewhere between social types and real people we\\'re supposed to empathize with, Janet and her bickering guests come across as cartoon bourgeois, thinly-drawn and wooden in their line delivery like dummies of a ventriloquist bent on caricaturing a privileged elite whose private messes give the lie to their brave talk of dedication to the masses. Is the message here that given half a chance, everyone\\'s a jerk? A tacked-on moment of genuine tragedy, followed by more knockabout farce, only jars. Will the gun, pointed pointedly at the camera in the opening scene, go off in the third act? By then I was so busy cooking up Hitler memes to overlay Ganz\\'s smiling bromides, I barely noticed the twist ending. An earlier version of this story spelled Adolf Hitler\\'s first name as Adolph.

Williams plays Mose Wright, the uncle of Emmett Till, in the Oscar-nominated short film My Nephew Emmett. Kevin Wilson Jr hide caption As is often the case, this year's crop of Academy Award-nominated live action shorts — several of them made as newbie filmmakers' calling cards — make up in earnest humanity for what they lack in technical sophistication. One way or another, all of this year's nominees turn on themes of terror — that's if you count the lone comedy, which speaks to the fear, fantasy, or wishful thought that psychiatrists may be crazier than their patients. Here they are, ranked from best ... to best-intentioned. The most accomplished and beautiful of the year's nominees, this NYU pre-thesis film by Kevin Wilson Jr. was inspired by real-life videotaped testimony from the uncle of Emmett Till. (Till was lynched in Mississippi in 1955, while visiting from Chicago, after a local white woman complained that he had wolf-whistled her.) The film quietly imagines what it felt like to be Till's uncle Mose (played by a dignified L.B. Williams) in the nocturnal hours between hearing of Emmett's alleged offense and the retribution he fears will follow. Shot mostly in close-up and without sensationalism, My Nephew Emmett movingly captures the old man's mounting dread and sense of powerlessness as he waits out the night in silence until racist thugs arrive. We know how it ended, but Wilson's point is that when racism and inequality are baked into everyday life, their victims are routinely forced to go about expecting the worst. A heavyset and heavily armed student barges into the office of an Atlanta, Georgia elementary school. Faced with the infinite compassion and good sense of the school secretary, the would-be shooter collapses into inept panic while he and the administrator discuss next steps with a police responder over the phone. Based on an actual 911 call placed during an attempted school shooting, Reed Van Dyk's drama hovers adroitly between farce and horror without losing our empathy for both parties to the bizarre exchange. or our sense that shooters badly need help too. Tara Riggs is excellent as the African-American secretary, cool as a cucumber and humane to the film's last, terrifying moment. In this enjoyably punch-drunk farce out of Australia, a temporary secretary arrives for work at the office of a psychiatrist. The man she meets may be the psychiatrist or he may be a patient — but he's definitely a stuffed shirt. When someone else claiming to be the real shrink shows up for work, a diagnostic face-off between the two escalates hilariously into rising hysteria as they duke it out in a doomed struggle to remain professional under duress. At issue is the ubiquity of delusion and self-regard in the helping biz, and director Derin Seale, with splendidly zany assistance from actors Josh Lawson and Damon Herriman, ups the ante with precise control over the uncontrollable. Based on a real-life 2015 attack in which Kenyan Muslim commuters rose up to protect their minority-Christian fellow travelers from a savage attack by terrorists, this inspiring German-Kenyan co-production focuses less on the inevitable carnage than on the crucible of anxiety, mistrust, anger and pain that festers between the two communities, their daily antagonism exacerbated by fundamentalist forces. Director Katja Benrath ably scales down the conflict to an evolving encounter on the bus between a young Christian widow and a Muslim teacher, both with ample reason to hate, both with enough humanity to rise above their private suffering. Weakened by the axe it so loudly grinds, this conventional short film turns on a little girl growing up deaf in a well-heeled but neglectful British family with parents who resent the efforts of a skilled young therapist to introduce her to communication skills that will ease her passage into the hearing world. Though smoothly directed by actor Chris Overton from a capable script by Rachel Shenton, the film rushes to judgment on the child's careerist (read, overwhelmed) mother, builds in a plot twist to further demonize the child's parents, then pushes relentlessly ahead to its conclusion. The Silent Child plays fine as a PSA for sign language; as drama, it's loaded dice.

Magnolia Pictures hide caption In 2012 Ben Lewin made The Sessions, an irreverent and perceptive fact-based dramedy with John Hawkes as a horny, lovelorn polio survivor in an iron lung, and Helen Hunt as his sex surrogate. Lewin, too, had polio as a child, which may account for his nuanced ability to picture the disabled as, you know, people who happen to be carrying an extra load. Lewin's new film about a young woman with autism mines disability terrain again. But the writer-director seems less at ease, less able to make the material his own and take the risky chances with tone and character that made The Sessions such a fresh delight. In every respect but one, the perfectly pleasant drama Please Stand By is a standard American coming-of-age tale about a plucky youngster who takes to the road to prove her mettle to herself and other interested parties. She has a screenplay tucked under her arm for the journey, but that's not the twist here. Wendy, who's played in a pleasingly low key by Dakota Fanning, is on the spectrum, and she's played here simply and efficiently, as a whole person with disadvantages that make life difficult. Hugging and eye contact are out of the question, and she needs strict routines to make daily living workable. Wendy has made great strides in an enlightened group-home run by a mostly unflappable manager named Scottie (hang on to that name), played by the excellent Toni Collette. But the human longing for connection, for feeling useful and productive and capable, are all in place; they're just harder for someone like Wendy to fulfill. She wants to go home to her older sister, Audrey (Alice Eve), who did her best to raise Wendy after the premature death of their single mother, but who now has a family of her own to consider. That's one roadblock; another is that the deadline to enter Wendy's Star Trek-inspired script in a Hollywood competition is almost up. Star Trek fans (several of the latter appear in pudding-basin haircuts to test Wendy's trivia savvy) will understand from the get-go why Wendy is obsessed with the television series. The rest of us must wait for a charming cameo at the end by a familiar face playing a cop who's fluent in Klingon. After a debilitating row with Audrey, Wendy lights out for Los Angeles, carrying only her script and her savings from her soul-crushing job at a local Cinnabon. In her bag is a pooch named Pete whose cuteness is fun, but a net loss that undercuts Lewin's intent, which is to get us to see that if the everyday uncertainties of living are hard enough for those of us lucky enough to possess navigational skills, they're so much tougher for someone whose equilibrium depends on adherence to rigid routine. More than most young woman on the road alone, Wendy is painfully vulnerable to exploitation. But here Lewin loses his way. Adversity strikes, but mildly, while benign strangers (Marla Gibbs!) keep popping up to run interference and help Wendy fend for herself.

Jacob Yakob/Roadside Attractions hide caption Based on a YA novel by Heidi McLaughlin, the endearingly old-fangled Forever My Girl is basically a stretched-out country music song with eye-catching Southern visuals and a familiar loop of lovelorn sorrow topped with uplift you can see coming from scene one. The woe comes on fast when a dewy young bride named Josie (Jessica Rothe) gets jilted at the altar by her high-school sweetheart, Liam, a pretty, green-eyed fellow with a lot of fetching chin stubble. He and his music are nicely played by Alex Roe, who is British but not so\\'s you\\'d notice. Eager to hit the big time, a panicked Liam takes off for New Orleans, though why he can\\'t take Josie with him is a mystery that will languish unexplained until shortly before the close. Eight years pass, and we find Liam, a deeply unhappy country music god in all the usual ways — drugs, booze, groupies. He writes and performs songs with blaring themes like \"I\\'d Give it All Up for You.\" Concertgoers, average age thirteen, are ecstatic, but Liam sits around pining over a message on an ancient cell phone until a convenient tragedy propels him homeward. There he lands in deep doo-doo with a singularly unreceptive Josie, to say nothing of his entire hometown populace and his father, who happens to be the local pastor. Liam may have been golden among the fleshpots of New Orleans, but when he first blows into town, everyone wants to slug him or ignore him. Everyone, that is, except for a feisty young girl named Billy (Abby Ryder Fortson), who is lumbered with dialogue better suited to a cocky teenager, and who is destined to bestow much-needed character-firming on the prodigal from out of town. Writer-director Bethany Ashton Wolf has a deft way with actors, and Peter Cambor is especially good as Liam\\'s long-suffering but humane manager. The movie flows along atmospherically with a country soundtrack corralling our emotions. The problem is not the well-worn plot or familiar characters, but the fact that Wolf adds no depth or complication to either that would make the film her own. Marinated in country-music mythology, Forever My Girl extracts every last ounce of juice from the potent fantasy binary of small town integrity versus big city sin, before marrying the two with minimal fuss and bother that must have looked plausible on paper. One sermon about forgiveness from the pastor, and instant turnaround ensues. Copious hugging ensues as well, and in a trice Liam is happily digging flowerbeds and coming on like a mature family man. Of running time necessity, the love of his life defrosts more slowly, until at last we arrive at the statutory eleventh-hour lapse the almost derails Liam\\'s makeover, but helps him get in touch with the source of his pain. Not that anyone in this pleasant, glib movie has to sacrifice a thing. Josie may be a small-town girl, but it turns out that she, too, knows how to play to the roar of the crowd in the fleshpots of New Orleans. Cakes are had and eaten, all\\'s well between the country and the city, and ... that\\'s a wrap.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 3225}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/01/18/578292638/forever-my-girl-a-familiar-tune-played-too-simply?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-01-18', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 555, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'The problem is not the well-worn plot or familiar characters, but the fact that Wolf adds no depth or complication to either that would make the film her own.'}}\n",

Film Movement hide caption In Between, a bold, brassy and beautiful first feature about living while Arab and female in Israel, was made by a young Palestinian woman with Israeli funding. But that is not what earned writer-director Maysaloun Hamoud a fatwa from her own people. Set in Tel Aviv, Israel's most secular and free-wheeling city, the movie glances briefly and with astringent black humor at the contradictions of living in a Jewish-dominated world whose Arab citizens are often treated with fear and suspicion. Mostly, though, In Between points a accusatory finger at the ways in which Arab patriarchy and its enablers try to keep things medieval for their upcoming young women. Politically this is fire-breathing material, but Hamoud's skill at pop storytelling and mastery of shifting tones are such that In Between unfolds less as a polemic than as a warmly human, often very funny, sporadically tragic story about three young women who are far more fleshed-out than they might seem on paper. Still, gender politics is built into character without apology here. Laila (Mouna Hawa), a feisty criminal lawyer whose swaying, willowy beauty puts one in mind of Amal Clooney, lives with her friend Salma (Sana Jammalieh), a sulky but warm-hearted lesbian bartender and DJ, under the radar but far from in secret. They share a cramped but inviting apartment whose vivid palette and design — emerald-green walls, red furniture, pineapple table lamp — may make you hanker for your own adventurous early adulthood. The two drink, smoke and party into the small hours with similarly boho, mostly gay male friends and sympathetic Jewish Israelis. When the plump, pretty and devoutly Muslim Nur (Shaden Kanbour), a student completing her degree in computer science, shows up as their new roommate, the two treat her with cool amusement that quickly turns to concern and then rage when her pious, overbearing fiancé (Henry Andrawes) turns savagely abusive in a rape scene that — appropriately — gives no quarter. The ensuing revenge plot is entirely satisfying and funny. But the movie's allure lies in Hamoud's intimately detailed world-building of a Palestinian subculture seldom seen in Israeli public life, let alone onscreen. As the three young women emerge from the shadows of tact and subterfuge, In Between draws its energies from their struggles to live between the cracks of several cultures, each of which extracts its own sacrifice of identity. Tough though it may be to deal with a Jewish state that treats its Arab citizens with mistrust, it is if anything more challenging for Laila, Salma and Nur to defend their independence to an older generation of families whose values they no longer share. There's little sense of grievance or victimhood here, only a liberating anger and a sharp but empathic intelligence that pops up in unexpected places. The lone understanding male in Nur's world turns out to be a much older close relative. Conversely, when Laila's handsome, hip, ostensibly secular boyfriend (Mahmoud Shalaby) suddenly wants her to give up smoking for propriety's sake, you can be sure that their rift — we are brought to see that the problem is much wider and deeper than smoking — won't resolve with make-up sex. Hamoud's narrative instincts can be broad, but she is rarely glib or coy. That she has chosen to focus squarely on internal tensions within the Arab community — the widening cultural and political gulf between the generations — is a mark of her courage, her bravado and her brutal honesty.\", 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 3635}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575283006/sharp-bracingly-funny-film-about-3-young-women-living-in-between?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=movies', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2018-01-04', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 597, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"There's little sense of grievance or victimhood here, only a liberating anger and a sharp but empathic intelligence that pops up in unexpected places.\"}}\n",

Susie Allnutt/Sony Pictures Classics hide caption Underrated in her \\'50s heyday and forgotten by many outside the noir aficionados who restored her to posthumous cinephile glory, the Hollywood movie star Gloria Grahame both endured and brought on herself a difficult life. A versatile actress who subtly telegraphed subterranean emotional complication, Grahame was mostly cast as seductive wantons, from the simpering minx saved from a life of infamy by Jimmy Stewart in Frank Capra\\'s It\\'s a Wonderful Life (1946) to the callow Southern belle she played in Vincente Minnelli\\'s 1952 The Bad and the Beautiful, for which she won an Academy Award for best supporting actress. But it was her brilliant turn as a siren with depth opposite Humphrey Bogart\\'s devious screenwriter in Nicholas Ray\\'s 1950 noir classic In a Lonely Place that keeps the Grahame flame today. That film is referenced more than once in Paul McGuigan\\'s bold new film about Grahame\\'s final years, which were scarred by rejection, illness, and pain. It wouldn\\'t have taken much to squeeze a rancid bio-pic — Sunset Boulevard Part Deux — out of the actress\\' farewell fling in the late 1970s with Peter Turner, a British working class man half her age. Film Stars Don\\'t Die in Liverpool is not that film, in part because it\\'s based on Turner\\'s generous 1986 memoir about their affair and Grahame\\'s stay, after the two had broken up, in the modest home of his family, who cared for the 57-year-old actress through the penultimate stage of a recurrent cancer she refused to acknowledge or treat. Adapted from Turner\\'s book by Matt Greenhalgh, Film Stars is not especially subtle filmmaking. The period soundtrack is a touch obvious; people literally walk through doors into their past or future; and a climactic scene that fulfills a lifelong dream of Grahame is pure cheese, though it may also be true. Contrivance aside, though, the movie offers a tough and tender love story that\\'s also clear-eyed about the multiple motivations that both deepened and muddied the bond between a struggling young actor and a former star old enough to be his mother. Grahame came with a colorful marital history that brought her notoriety marrying her stepson after divorcing his father, Nicholas Ray. Turner was no innocent either, and if Grahame was robbing the cradle, Greenhalgh is refreshingly disinclined to fill in with early-life back story for either of the two. If anything Turner, who\\'s played with appealing directness by Jamie Bell (Billy Elliot), is closer to the adult in the room after the two meet in 1979 in the seedy London rooming house where Grahame rehearses for a stage play she plainly regards as well below her league. \"She always played the tart,\" the landlady whispers by way of introduction. Turner is more intrigued than put off, and in short order he and Grahame (Annette Bening) bond over disco and land first in bed, and then in a love affair as filled with mutual delight as it is loaded with insecurities of both parties. From there the action shuttles to and fro across the Atlantic, chronicling the couple\\'s tumultuous affair and the long tail of friendship it left in its wake. In California, Peter, besotted with all things Hollywood, hears some unsettling news about his lover from her admiring, batty mother (Vanessa Redgrave) and her embittered sister (France Barber). In New York, Grahame is in diva mode, throwing fits even as she hides a secret that imperils the trust between the couple. But Bening comes into her own back in wet, tawdry Liverpool, where a sick Grahame takes refuge and, from the depths of her own lonely place, reveals her craving for what Peter brings with him — a tight-knit family, headed by Julie Walters, a kindly matriarch in a terrifying period wig. By turns kittenish, imperious, peacock-proud when a modest success on stage restores some her former sexual allure, and quietly despairing, Bening — who bears a startling resemblance to Grahame in her later years — is characteristically superb at channeling a vibrantly volatile inner life the actress was rarely allowed to express on-screen. Bening\\'s expert runs up and down the emotional register leave no room for doubt about Grahame\\'s charisma even when she\\'s playing her own worst enemy. Along with so many other glamour pusses of her generation, she was also a casualty of Hollywood. That the actress who plays her in Film Stars Don\\'t Die with such pathos and wry elan now enjoys a thriving late-life career makes you wonder what Grahame herself, who died at 57 in New York of peritonitis, might have done with the same opportunities. Me, I like to imagine Grahame rising from the ashes to direct her own In a Lonely Place, restoring the siren from Nicholas Ray\\'s reversal to her original fate in Dorothy B. Hughes\\' wonderful novel, her own glam self in the lead once again, opposite Peter Turner.', 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4938}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2017/12/28/574091318/in-a-liverpool-love-story-one-versatile-leading-lady-plays-another', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2017-12-29', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 829, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"Bening's expert runs up and down the emotional register leave no room for doubt about Grahame's charisma even when she's playing her own worst enemy.\"}}\n",

Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer) and Fletcher (Mark Wahlberg) in All The Money In The World. Giles Keyte/All The Money US, LLC. hide caption In case you're wondering whether the last-minute dropping of Kevin Spacey ruined Ridley Scott's movie about the 1973 kidnapping of billionaire J. Paul Getty's grandson, I can testify that there's barely a technical seam showing in All the Money in the World. Scott is a master craftsman who re-shot Spacey's scenes in nine days without turning a hair. And Christopher Plummer, fresh off playing that other Scrooge in The Man Who Invented Christmas, brings a mischievous pinch of irony to his turn as the world's richest skinflint, who won infamy for refusing to pay the $17 million ransom demanded by Italian kidnappers of his favorite grandson, John Paul Getty III. Charlie Plummer, no relation but also very good, plays the vapid boy who's carried off in an ancient microbus while cruising hookers in Rome. Still, Spacey's replacement is not the story here, if only because All the Money is less a Getty biopic than a pounding thriller beefed up by Gail, Getty Junior's steely mother, who battles to secure her son's release. As such, it is very much Michelle Williams' place to shine, abetted — in a gratifying low key — by Mark Wahlberg as the former CIA agent and Getty sidekick who helps her recover her son in the teeth of Getty Senior's cunning recalcitrance. Bouncing around in time and place (Getty had an abundance of scenic European mansions, we learn, in which to wash and line-dry his undies and charge visitors for their phone calls), the movie hits the ground running as a caper, with the grab carried out by Mafiosi who is at once vicious and comically inept. Young John Paul's minder, a sympathetic, if dimly-bulbed fellow, is played with artfully dabbed dirt on his face, and an oversized Italian accent, by Romain Duris, who's noticeably French. Pasta will be reliably guzzled while you're waiting to see how Scott handles the lopping of the young heir's ear, to be dispatched to his relatives by regular mail as proof that the young wastrel remains alive for now. I'll just say that the same orifice removal in Reservoir Dogs pales in comparison. In its last hour All the Money ratchets up to an elegant thriller, albeit one that, the filmmakers openly admit, fiddles somewhat with the facts. But even with a screenplay (by David Scarpa, based on a book by John Pearson) that groans with backstory exposition, the movie is more slippery at completing the thought its title implies. From Citizen Kane to There Will Be Blood, American cinema is awash with filthy-rich monsters, and nothing could be timelier right now than an inquiry into the character of a man who sees all of life as a commercial transaction in which he must outwit adversaries he can't trust. What shapes a man who is capable of using his grandson, already a hostage to unscrupulous evildoers, as a bargaining chip with which to settle scores with his daughter-in-law? Plummer's Getty is an operator at once wily and pathetic, a man whose only rule-book is the art of the deal, and whose every human interaction is guided by extracting more profit or outmaneuvering those he regards as adversaries. He craves family but treats his relatives with less care than he brings to the beloved paintings that never talk back. All this is on the record, but we come to see Getty more fully through the discerning eyes of the only player in this tawdry drama who has his number and shows herself willing to stand up to him. Williams plays Gail as a woman under enormous, sustained stress, yet possessed of a maternal core so strong that no hurdle, especially those thrown up by Getty, can stop her efforts to rescue her son. Money can't buy her, and though there's no telling if Gail's role in the rescue's serpentine twists really happened this way, it's Williams' tightly wound, calculating performance that juices the movie's thrill ride of a last hour, and turns it into a revelation.\", 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 4029}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2017/12/21/571929695/all-the-money-in-the-world-and-worth-every-penny', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2017-12-21', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 692, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': \"It's Williams' tightly wound, calculating performance that juices the movie's thrill ride of a last hour, and turns it into a revelation.\"}}\n",

Grady Mitchell/IFC Films hide caption A guy walks into an Alaska bar at night. The bar is called Chums, and his two pals are deep in heated discussion about an upcoming election and the fabulous age of business dominance to come in its wake. The dialogue is not played for winks at the audience, and Sweet Virginia is not, now or later, one of those jokey neo-noirs that keeps poking the genre in the ribs. Next thing you know, a stranger — young, good-looking, intense — comes in demanding the Early Bird Special. When told, none too politely, that the kitchen is closed, the young man commits an act of efficient violence that leaves three men dead in this small town before the credits have rolled. The brutality we see is suggestive rather than visceral, and though more blood will be spilled before the close, the movie is driven less by action than by the expertly paced buildup of pervasive unease among friends and family of the deceased. At least one of the survivors, we learn early on, has a direct prior connection to the killer, a drifter by the name of Elwood who's played by Christopher Abbott with the same explosive understatement he brought to his role as the self-destructive New Yorker in the outstanding 2015 film James White. But every wounded soul we will come to know is impacted by the murder, including two insufficiently bereaved wives played by Imogen Poots and Rosemarie Dewitt, and Sam (Daredevil's Jon Bernthal, softened into a gentle giant), a former rodeo champion who now trudges through a dreary existence as manager of a motel that's a magnet for angry, depressed, or staggeringly unreliable narrators. True to genre, Sweet Virginia slyly undermines the mythology of small-town folksiness and warmth that American pop culture has long sold itself. That's not especially new, but at a minimum the movie offers the pleasures of a leisurely paced, if far from slack, noir directed with elegant assurance by Jamie M. Dagg. A suitably monosyllabic script by the China Brothers never falls into the arch belittling of its characters that maroons so much of today's neo-noir in clever cynicism. If anything, the filmmakers show a rare, unsentimental tenderness toward the inhabitants of this ground-down Nowheresville, beautifully photographed by Jessica Lee Gagne against the bucolic majesty of mountainous Alaska and accented with a haunting minimalist score by Brooke and Will Blair. What sets Sweet Virginia above the pack is a leisurely inquiry into the moral rot that seeps into the very bones of lives bent out of shape by disappointment, frustration, loneliness or the absence of love. We are brought to understand the deep undertow of hurt that causes a young wife to lash out in revenge on a cheating husband, the low-key despair that brings another to seeks refuge from a loveless marriage in an affair that may or may not hold out the promise of real affection. And in the rundown motel, the go-to address of so much cumulative misery, a strangely compelling intimacy grows between two men who find kinship in the punishing cumulative losses each has sustained. Their friendship can't last. The low-level dread that washes through this benighted place builds to a crisis that gets resolved with a weapon whose provenance subtly invites us to glance at the ugly ideologies that currently infect such communities, bringing rage and random violence in their wake. And still there's an organic unity to the hint at sweet relief that comes at the end, as Sweet Virginia takes a welcome time out from the confines of genre to offer two lost souls the gift of future happiness.\", 'spanAttribution': [{'authorID': 'a80b433f-e737-206c-625e-973e341a972f', 'start': 0, 'end': 3656}], 'isNeedle': False, 'collectionNum': 'HRS 1', 'source': 'https://www.npr.org/2017/11/16/563340268/sweet-virginia-small-town-noir-with-a-slice-of-hope', 'dateCollected': '2023-09-28', 'dateCreated': '2017-11-16', 'publiclyAvailable': True, 'deidentified': True, 'languages': ['en'], 'lengthWords': 617, 'sourceSpecific': {'authorName': 'ella-taylor', 'rtSummary': 'What sets Sweet Virginia above the pack is a leisurely inquiry into the moral rot that seeps into the very bones of lives bent out of shape by disappointment, frustration, loneliness or the absence of love.'}}\n",

Nicola Dove/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption \"Can we please stop with the remakes of Murder on the Orient Express?\" I ask upon exiting Kenneth Branagh\\'s fatally tepid new reading of the Agatha Christie classic. For my money, David Suchet already nailed the most satisfying Hercule Poirot we\\'re ever likely to know. In the British television series Agatha Christie\\'s Poirot (which aired on PBS in the States), if not the wholly unnecessary 2010 movie, Suchet\\'s Belgian detective came to us as his own complicated loner — sly, prissy, compulsive, sexually ambiguous and with a thoroughly earned tragic vision of humankind, yet full of compassion for its individual membership. When Suchet\\'s Poirot insisted he was happiest when alone, we believed him. But coming from Branagh\\'s Poirot, there is room for doubt — and not only because his lips can barely move beneath a mustache so humongous it curls around corners, possibly in an attempt at a getaway. That hairy party favor — with Branagh behind it, incessantly cracking wise and foolish — leads the action. We meet Poirot at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, a scenic locale that may or may not connect to later events. For now it\\'s an excuse for the smirky private eye to launch into a lame gag about rabbis, imams and priests. Then it\\'s on to Istanbul, where the self-professed \"greatest detective in the world\" boards the famously deluxe locomotive for a hard-earned break among bejeweled toffs moping about in richly varnished wooden carriages with to-die-for light fixtures. The mustache wears a coat in bed, where we dally with Poirot until Johnny Depp shows up as an iffy-looking \"businessman\" who, after trying in vain to hire the sleuth as his bodyguard, turns up dead on schedule. In deference to the six people on this planet who don\\'t know that his multiple stab wounds weren\\'t inflicted by the butler, in the library, with a poker, I must keep heroically mum about whodunit. Truthfully it\\'s hard to work up a head of suspense about the killer because once the train screeches to a halt on a box girder bridge, it\\'s all tedious talk by name actors looking shifty or inscrutable or insisting against all odds that they\\'re the guilty party. When Agatha Christie maneuvered a large crowd of potential perps into a confined space, she was not just plot-thickening, but finding a way to explore human character in all its rainbow of delusion, rationalization and displaced guilt. For Branagh, it\\'s little more than a golden opportunity to make us \"ooh\" and \"aah\" over a clutch of majorly attired big Hollywood guns from Judi Dench and Derek Jacobi to Michelle Pfeiffer, Willem Dafoe and Penelope Cruz, plus a strategic sprinkling of young \\'uns and a weak stab at diverse casting. The slight twist that Branagh and screenwriter Michael Green have placed on this crew\\'s shared tie to the deceased doesn\\'t compel, because they generate no interest as characters. They\\'re movie stars draped in tableaux, and we are left following them through the carriages in showy aerial shots and tracking shots, or gazing at the expensive furs and the splendid snow-covered mountains. After a stream of gags about how Poirot likes his oeufs cooked, we transition to unearned poignancy as the movie lumbers home to a denouement — one that, in all fairness to the filmmakers, was never one of Christie\\'s finest and that has going for it only a ham-fisted democratic impulse. Violins soar amid snow-covered mountains. Poirot stops his quipping and gazes mournfully into the middle distance for a bit. A very short bit. Poirot follows this brief lunge into gravitas with a cheery wink and a nod that having sorted this lot out, he is off to try his luck on the Nile, nudge nudge.

Still, when not buffed to the gills and poured into a Mad Men power suit, Hamm looks scaled down to affably human; even the granite jaw aims to please. The Prime’s agreeable nature will become relevant, if only because the movie, adapted by director Michael Almereyda from Jordan Harrison’s Pulitzer-nominated stage play, is in part an inquiry into the evolving connection between us humans and the technology we’ve created. Hamm represents a mostly obedient piece of software named Walter, who’s been programmed to boost the flagging memory of Marjorie (the incomparable Lois Smith, reprising her stage role), an elderly widow in need of comfort as she struggles through early dementia. Walter is such a good replica of Marjorie’s husband in his youth that we wouldn’t know he’s transparent were it not for a puckish moment when someone walks through his foot. Blink and you might miss this and other lo-fi special effects. Always inventive with form and ideas, Almereyda is rarely experimental just for the hell of it: his 2000 Hamlet had the Great Dane deliver “To be or not to be” under a “Go Home Happy” sign at a Blockbuster Video store—and in context it was no cliché. The minimal CGI in Marjorie Prime subtly abets the philosophical dressing on a moving, if psychologically familiar, family drama with a tech twist. The flashbacks that fill us in on Marjorie’s painfully checkered family history are deployed with a light touch. Almereyda opens up the play’s one-room set into a beachside house sleekly furnished in the beige and brown and stained wood you’d expect from well-heeled Hamptons WASPs. Skeletons march out of cupboards on cue, but this isn’t Edward Albee territory: these are posh people who conduct their fights in a genteel whisper. The backstory to their current sufferings is sensitively rendered, if standard fare. We hear of inattentive parenting, sibling rivalry, depression, and a tragic death with a long reach into the present and future. Scripted for resentment and eternal hunger for affection, Marjorie’s daughter Tess (a finely tuned Geena Davis) sees rivals everywhere, is estranged from her own daughter, and resents the Prime who’s standing in for her withholding father. Her solicitous husband Jon (Tim Robbins) positions himself as the family mediator, yet seems to enjoy himself a touch too much topping up the Prime he created with new data to enhance—and possibly edit—Marjorie’s memory bank. This may seem like glum material, but Marjorie Prime is refreshingly free of the rote doom and gloom that clings to many movies addressing the Great Tech Takeover. Jon is no more sinister than the quiescent Walter, he of the oft-repeated recorded response to new information, “I’ll remember that now.” Yet this house is stacked with unreliable narrators (though Walter and Marjorie both display a subversive kick), all of them floundering in a slippery time frame that is skillfully rendered by Almereyda as fluid and without boundaries. Does it matter that all memory is by neuro-scientific definition faulty or interpretive? How will the increasingly fuzzy line between human and digital memory change the way we relate to one another and live on in others’ memories? Whether someday soon we will all need (or get regardless) our own Primes is just one of the questions this likable but slightly anodyne movie raises yet doesn’t really run with. That may be a weakness in the play, and Almereyda, expertly juggling the tonal shifts between mordant and elegiac, keeps the faith. Those who admire the work of this bold innovator may be disappointed that he has muffled his own voice in the process. Ella Taylor writes about film for NPR.org, The Criterion Collection, and others.
